## 7 Modifiability 可修改性

<!--https://blog.csdn.net/susemm/article/details/122770672-->

_Adapt or perish, now as ever, is nature’s inexorable imperative._   
_适应或灭亡，现在和以往一样，是大自然的必然要求。_   

—H.G. Wells 赫伯特·乔治·威尔斯

Change happens.
变化发生了。

Study after study shows that most of the cost of the typical software system occurs after it has been initially released. If change is the only constant in the universe, then software change is not only constant but ubiquitous. Changes happen to add new features, to change or even retire old ones. Changes happen to fix defects, tighten security, or improve performance. Changes happen to enhance the user’s experience. Changes happen to embrace new technology, new platforms, new protocols, new standards. Changes happen to make systems work together, even if they were never designed to do so.

一项又一项的研究表明，典型软件系统的大部分成本是在最初发布之后发生的。 如果变化是宇宙中唯一的常数，那么软件变更不仅是常数，而且无处不在。 变更发生在：添加新功能、更改甚至淘汰旧功能。变更发生在：修复缺陷、加强安全性或提高性能。变更发生在：增强用户的体验。 变更发生在：拥抱新技术、新平台、新协议、新标准。变更发生在：使系统协同工作，即使它们从未被设计成能够协同工作。

Modifiability is about change, and our interest in it centers on the cost and risk of making changes. To plan for modifiability, an architect has to consider four questions:

可修改性与变更有关，而我们对变更的兴趣集中在变更的成本和风险上。 为了计划可修改性，架构师必须考虑四个问题：

* _What can change?_ A change can occur to any aspect of a system: the functions that the system computes, the platform (the hardware, operating system, middleware), the environment in which the system operates (the systems with which it must interoperate, the protocols it uses to communicate with the rest of the world), the qualities the system exhibits (its performance, its reliability, and even its future modifications), and its capacity (number of users supported, number of simultaneous operations).
   _有什么可以改变的？_ 系统的任何方面都可能发生变化：系统计算的功能，平台（硬件，操作系统，中间件），系统运行的环境（必须与之进行互操作的系统，所使用的协议） 与世界各地进行通信），系统所表现出的质量（其性能，可靠性，甚至将来的修改）以及容量（所支持的用户数量，同时运行的数量）。
* _What is the likelihood of the change?_ One cannot plan a system for all potential changes—the system would never be done, or if it was done it would be far too expensive and would likely suffer quality attribute problems in other dimensions. Although anything might change, the architect has to make the tough decisions about which changes are likely, and hence which changes are to be supported, and which are not.
   _更改的可能性是多少？_ 一个人不能为所有潜在的变化计划一个系统-该系统将永远无法完成，或者如果完成了，那将太昂贵了，并且可能会遇到其他方面的质量属性问题。 尽管可能会发生任何变化，但架构师必须做出艰难的决定，即可能发生哪些更改，因此要支持哪些更改，哪些不支持。
* _When is the change made and who makes it?_ Most commonly in the past, a change was made to source code. That is, a developer had to make the change, which was tested and then deployed in a new release. Now, however, the question of when a change is made is intertwined with the question of who makes it. An end user changing the screen saver is clearly making a change to one of the aspects of the system. Equally clear, it is not in the same category as changing the system so that it can be used over the web rather than on a single machine. Changes can be made to the implementation (by modifying the source code), during compile (using compile-time switches), during build (by choice of libraries), during configuration setup (by a range of techniques, including parameter setting), or during execution (by parameter settings, plugins, etc.). A change can also be made by a developer, an end user, or a system administrator.
   _何时进行更改，谁进行更改？_ 过去最常见的情况是对源代码进行了更改。 也就是说，开发人员必须进行更改，然后进行测试，然后将其部署到新版本中。 但是，现在，何时进行更改的问题与谁进行更改的问题交织在一起。 最终用户更改屏幕保护程序显然是在更改系统的各个方面。 同样清楚的是，它与更改系统不在同一类别，因此可以在Web上而不是在单台计算机上使用。 可以在实现过程中（通过修改源代码），在编译过程中（使用编译时开关），在构建过程中（通过选择库），在配置设置过程中（通过一系列技术，包括参数设置）进行更改。 在执行期间（通过参数设置，插件等）。 开发人员，最终用户或系统管理员也可以进行更改。
* _What is the cost of the change?_ Making a system more modifiable involves two types of cost:
   _更改的费用是多少？_ 使系统更具可修改性涉及两种成本：
   * The cost of introducing the mechanism(s) to make the system more modifiable
      引入机制以使系统更易于修改的成本
   * The cost of making the modification using the mechanism(s)
      使用机制进行修改的费用

For example, the simplest mechanism for making a change is to wait for a change request to come in, then change the source code to accommodate the request. The cost of introducing the mechanism is zero; the cost of exercising it is the cost of changing the source code and revalidating the system. At the other end of the spectrum is an application generator, such as a user interface builder. The builder takes as input a description of the designer user interface produced through direct manipulation techniques and produces (usually) source code. The cost of introducing the mechanism is the cost of constructing the UI builder, which can be substantial. The cost of using the mechanism is the cost of producing the input to feed the builder (cost can be substantial or negligible), the cost of running the builder (approximately zero), and then the cost of whatever testing is performed on the result (usually much less than usual).

例如，进行更改的最简单机制是等待更改请求进入，然后更改源代码以适应该请求。 引入该机制的成本为零； 实施它的成本就是更改源代码并重新验证系统的成本。 另一极端是应用程序生成器，例如用户界面生成器。 构建器将通过直接操纵技术生成的设计器用户界面的描述作为输入，并生成（通常）源代码。 引入该机制的成本是构建UI构建器的成本，这可能是巨大的。 使用该机制的成本是产生输入以供生成器使用的成本（成本可以是实质性的或可忽略的），运行生成器的成本（大约为零），然后是对结果执行任何测试的成本（ 通常比平常少得多）。

For N similar modifications, a simplified justification for a change mechanism is that

对于N个类似的修改，更改机制的简化理由是：

```
N × Cost of making the change without the mechanism < Cost of installing the mechanism + (N × Cost of making the change using the mechanism).

N × 在没有机制的情况下进行更改的成本 < 安装机制的成本 + （N × 使用该机制进行更改的成本）。
```

N is the anticipated number of modifications that will use the modifiability mechanism, but N is a prediction. If fewer changes than expected come in, then an expensive modification mechanism may not be warranted. In addition, the cost of creating the modifiability mechanism could be applied elsewhere—in adding functionality, in improving the performance, or even in nonsoftware investments such as buying tech stocks. Also, the equation does not take time into account. It might be cheaper in the long run to build a sophisticated change-handling mechanism, but you might not be able to wait for that.

N是将使用可修改性机制的预期修改数量，但是N是一个预测。 如果更改少于预期，则可能不需要昂贵的修改机制。 此外，创建可修改性机制的成本可以应用到其他地方，例如增加功能，提高性能，甚至用于非软件投资（如购买技术股票）。 同样，该方程式不考虑时间。 从长远来看，建立复杂的变更处理机制可能会更便宜，但是您可能无法等待。

### 7.1 Modifiability General Scenario 可修改性通用场景

From these considerations, we can see the portions of the modifiability general scenario:  
从这些考虑，我们可以看到可修改性通用方案的各个部分：

* _Source of stimulus_. This portion specifies who makes the change: the developer, a system administrator, or an end user.
* _激励的来源_。 此部分指定进行更改的人员：开发人员，系统管理员或最终用户。
* _Stimulus_. This portion specifies the change to be made. A change can be the addition of a function, the modification of an existing function, or the deletion of a function. (For this categorization, we regard fixing a defect as changing a function, which presumably wasn’t working correctly as a result of the defect.) A change can also be made to the qualities of the system: making it more responsive, increasing its availability, and so forth. The capacity of the system may also change. Accommodating an increasing number of simultaneous users is a frequent requirement. Finally, changes may happen to accommodate new technology of some sort, the most common of which is porting the system to a different type of computer or communication network.
* _激励_。 此部分指定要进行的更改。 更改可以是功能的添加，现有功能的修改或功能的删除。 （对于这种分类，我们认为修复缺陷是在更改功能，这可能是缺陷导致的功能无法正常工作。）还可以对系统的质量进行更改：提高系统的响应速度，增加其功能 可用性等等。 系统的容量也可能更改。 经常需要同时容纳越来越多的用户。 最后，可能会发生变化，以适应某种新技术，其中最常见的是将系统移植到其他类型的计算机或通信网络。
* _Artifact_. This portion specifies what is to be changed: specific components or modules, the system’s platform, its user interface, its environment, or another system with which it interoperates.
* _对象_。 此部分指定要更改的内容：特定的组件或模块，系统的平台，其用户界面，其环境或与之进行互操作的另一个系统。
* _Environment_. This portion specifies when the change can be made: design time, compile time, build time, initiation time, or runtime.
* _环境_。 此部分指定何时可以进行更改：设计时间，编译时间，构建时间，启动时间或运行时。
* _Response_. Make the change, test it, and deploy it.
* _反应_。 进行更改，测试并部署。
* Response measure. All of the possible responses take time and cost money; time and money are the most common response measures. Although both sound simple to measure, they aren’t. You can measure calendar time or staff time. But do you measure the time it takes for the change to wind its way through configuration control boards and approval authorities (some of whom may be outside your organization), or merely the time it takes your engineers to make the change? Cost usually means direct outlay, but it might also include opportunity cost of having your staff work on changes instead of other tasks. Other measures include the extent of the change (number of modules or other artifacts affected) or the number of new defects introduced by the change, or the effect on other quality attributes. If the change is being made by a user, you may wish to measure the efficacy of the change mechanisms provided, which somewhat overlaps with measures of usability (see Chapter 11).
* _反应测量_。 所有可能的响应都需要时间和金钱。 时间和金钱是最常见的应对措施。 尽管听起来都很容易衡量，但事实并非如此。 您可以测量日历时间或员工时间。 但是，您是衡量变更通过配置控制板和批准机构（其中一些可能不在组织内部）中花费的时间，还是仅衡量工程师进行变更所花费的时间？ 成本通常意味着直接支出，但也可能包括让员工进行变更而不是其他任务的机会成本。 其他度量包括更改的程度（受影响的模块或其他工件的数量），更改引起的新缺陷的数量或对其他质量属性的影响。 如果更改是由用户进行的，则您可能希望衡量所提供的更改机制的有效性，该有效性机制与可用性度量有所重叠（请参见第11章）。

Figure 7.1 illustrates a concrete modifiability scenario: The developer wishes to change the user interface by modifying the code at design time. The modifications are made with no side effects within three hours.  
图7.1说明了一个具体的可修改方案：开发人员希望通过在设计时修改代码来更改用户界面。 所做的修改在三个小时内没有副作用。

### 7.2 Tactics for Modifiability 可修改性策略

Tactics to control modifiability have as their goal controlling the complexity of making changes, as well as the time and cost to make changes. Figure 7.2 shows this relationship.  
控制可修改性的策略以控制更改的复杂性以及更改的时间和成本为目标。 图7.2显示了这种关系。

![]()
**Figure 7.2** The goal of modifiability tactics 可修改策略的目标

To understand modifiability, we begin with coupling and cohesion.  
为了理解可修改性，我们从耦合和内聚开始。

Modules have responsibilities. When a change causes a module to be modified, its responsibilities are changed in some way. Generally, a change that affects one module is easier and less expensive than if it changes more than one module. However, if two modules’ responsibilities overlap in some way, then a single change may well affect them both. We can measure this overlap by measuring the probability that a modification to one module will propagate to the other. This is called coupling, and high coupling is an enemy of modifiability.  
模块有职责。 当更改导致模块被修改时，其职责将以某种方式更改。 通常，与更改多个模块相比，影响一个模块的更改更容易且成本更低。 但是，如果两个模块的职责以某种方式重叠，则单个更改很可能会同时影响它们两个。 我们可以通过测量对一个模块的修改会传播到另一个模块的可能性来测量这种重叠。 这称为耦合，而高耦合是可修改性的敌人。

Cohesion measures how strongly the responsibilities of a module are related. Informally, it measures the module’s “unity of purpose.” Unity of purpose can be measured by the change scenarios that affect a module. The cohesion of a module is the probability that a change scenario that affects a responsibility will also affect other (different) responsibilities. The higher the cohesion, the lower the probability that a given change will affect multiple responsibilities. High cohesion is good; low cohesion is bad. The definition allows for two modules with similar purposes each to be cohesive.  
内聚性衡量模块的职责之间的关联程度。 非正式地，它衡量模块的“目的统一性”。目的统一性可以通过影响模块的变更方案来衡量。 模块的凝聚力是影响职责的变更方案也将影响其他（不同）职责的可能性。 凝聚力越高，给定变更将影响多个职责的可能性越低。 高内聚性好； 内聚力低是不好的。 该定义允许具有相同目的的两个模块具有内聚性。

Given this framework, we can now identify the parameters that we will use to motivate modifiability tactics:  
有了这个框架，我们现在可以确定用于激励可修改性策略的参数：

* _Size of a module_. Tactics that split modules will reduce the cost of making a modification to the module that is being split as long as the split is chosen to reflect the type of change that is likely to be made.
* _模块的大小_。 只要选择拆分以反映可能进行的更改的类型，拆分模块的策略将降低对正在拆分的模块进行修改的成本。
* _Coupling_. Reducing the strength of the coupling between two modules A and B will decrease the expected cost of any modification that affects A. Tactics that reduce coupling are those that place intermediaries of various sorts between modules A and B.
* _耦合_。 降低两个模块A和B之间的耦合强度将降低影响A的任何修改的预期成本。减少耦合的策略是将各种中介置于模块A和B之间的策略。
* _Cohesion_. If module A has a low cohesion, then cohesion can be improved by removing responsibilities unaffected by anticipated changes.
* _内聚_。 如果模块A的内聚性较低，则可以通过消除不受预期更改影响的职责来提高内聚性。

Finally we need to be concerned with when in the software development life cycle a change occurs. If we ignore the cost of preparing the architecture for the modification, we prefer that a change is bound as late as possible. Changes can only be successfully made (that is, quickly and at lowest cost) late in the life cycle if the architecture is suitably prepared to accommodate them. Thus the fourth and final parameter in a model of modifiability is this:  
最后，我们需要关注在软件开发生命周期中何时发生更改。 如果我们忽略了为修改准备架构的成本，那么我们希望更改绑定的时间尽可能晚。 如果架构已做好适当准备以适应变化，则只有在生命周期的后期才能成功进行更改（即，以最低的成本进行快速更改）。 因此，可修改性模型中的第四个也是最后一个参数是：
* _Binding time of modification_. An architecture that is suitably equipped to accommodate modifications late in the life cycle will, on average, cost less than an architecture that forces the same modification to be made earlier. The preparedness of the system means that some costs will be zero, or very low, for late life-cycle modifications. This, however, neglects the cost of preparing the architecture for the late binding.

  _修改的绑定时间_。 平均而言，一种适合于在生命周期后期适应修改的体系结构的成本要比强迫更早进行相同修改的体系结构的成本低。 系统的准备意味着对于后期生命周期修改，某些成本将为零或非常低。 但是，这忽略了为后期绑定准备架构的成本。

Now we may understand tactics and their consequences as affecting one or more of the previous parameters: reducing the size of a module, increasing cohesion, reducing coupling, and deferring binding time. These tactics are shown in Figure 7.3.  
现在，我们可能已经了解到战术及其影响到先前参数中的一个或多个的后果：减小模块的大小，增加内聚力，减少耦合和延迟绑定时间。 这些策略如图7.3所示。

![]()
**Figure 7.3** Modifiability tactics 可修改性策略

**Reduce the Size of a Module**  
**减少模块尺寸**

* _Split module_. If the module being modified includes a great deal of capability, the modification costs will likely be high. Refining the module into several smaller modules should reduce the average cost of future changes.

  _拆分模块_。 如果要修改的模块包含大量功能，则修改成本可能会很高。 将模块精简为几个较小的模块应减少将来更改的平均成本。

**Increase Cohesion**  
**增加内聚**

Several tactics involve moving responsibilities from one module to another. The purpose of moving a responsibility from one module to another is to reduce the likelihood of side effects affecting other responsibilities in the original module.  
几种策略涉及将职责从一个模块转移到另一个模块。 将职责从一个模块转移到另一个模块的目的是减少副作用影响原始模块中其他职责的可能性。

* _Increase semantic coherence_. If the responsibilities A and B in a module do not serve the same purpose, they should be placed in different modules. This may involve creating a new module or it may involve moving a responsibility to an existing module. One method for identifying responsibilities to be moved is to hypothesize likely changes that affect a module. If some responsibilities are not affected by these changes, then those responsibilities should probably be removed.

  _增加语义连贯性_。 如果模块中的职责A和B的目的不同，则应将它们放在不同的模块中。 这可能涉及创建新模块，也可能涉及将职责移至现有模块。 识别要转移的职责的一种方法是假设可能会影响模块的更改。 如果某些职责不受这些更改的影响，则应删除这些职责。

**Reduce Coupling**  **减少耦合**

We now turn to tactics that reduce the coupling between modules.  

现在，我们转向减少模块之间耦合的策略。

* _Encapsulate_. Encapsulation introduces an explicit interface to a module. This interface includes an application programming interface (API) and its associated responsibilities, such as “perform a syntactic transformation on an input parameter to an internal representation.” Perhaps the most common modifiability tactic, encapsulation reduces the probability that a change to one module propagates to other modules. The strengths of coupling that previously went to the module now go to the interface for the module. These strengths are, however, reduced because the interface limits the ways in which external responsibilities can interact with the module (perhaps through a wrapper). The external responsibilities can now only directly interact with the module through the exposed interface (indirect interactions, however, such as dependence on quality of service, will likely remain unchanged). Interfaces designed to increase modifiability should be abstract with respect to the details of the module that are likely to change—that is, they should hide those details.

  _封装_。封装为模块引入了显式接口。此接口包括一个应用程序编程接口（API）及其相关职责，例如“对输入参数进行语法转换以实现内部表示形式。”也许是最常见的可修改策略，封装降低了对一个模块的更改传播的可能性。到其他模块。以前用于模块的耦合强度现在转到模块的接口。但是，由于接口限制了外部职责与模块交互的方式（可能通过包装器），因此降低了这些优势。现在，外部职责只能通过公开的界面直接与模块进行交互（但是，诸如对服务质量的依赖之类的间接交互可能会保持不变）。旨在增加可修改性的接口应该相对于可能更改的模块细节是抽象的，也就是说，它们应该隐藏那些细节。

* _Use an intermediary_ breaks a dependency. Given a dependency between responsibility A and responsibility B (for example, carrying out A first requires carrying out B), the dependency can be broken by using an intermediary. The type of intermediary depends on the type of dependency. For example, a publish-subscribe intermediary will remove the data producer’s knowledge of its consumers. So will a shared data repository, which separates readers of a piece of data from writers of that data. In a service-oriented architecture in which services discover each other by dynamic lookup, the directory service is an intermediary.

  _使用中介_ 打破了依赖关系。 给定责任A和责任B之间的依赖关系（例如，首先执行A需要执行B），可以通过使用中介来打破这种依赖关系。 中介的类型取决于依赖性的类型。 例如，发布-订阅中间人将删除数据生产者对其消费者的了解。 共享数据存储库也是如此，该存储库将数据的读取器与数据的写入器区分开。 在服务通过动态查找彼此发现的面向服务的体系结构中，目录服务是中介。

* _Restrict dependencies_ is a tactic that restricts the modules that a given module interacts with or depends on. In practice this tactic is achieved by restricting a module’s visibility (when developers cannot see an interface, they cannot employ it) and by authorization (restricting access to only authorized modules). This tactic is seen in layered architectures, in which a layer is only allowed to use lower layers (sometimes only the next lower layer) and in the use of wrappers, where external entities can only see (and hence depend on) the wrapper and not the internal functionality that it wraps.

  _限制依赖关系_ 是一种策略，用于限制给定模块与之交互或依赖的模块。 实际上，通过限制模块的可见性（当开发人员看不到界面时，他们不能使用它）和授权（仅对授权模块的访问）来实现该策略。 这种策略体现在分层体系结构中，在分层体系结构中，仅允许一层使用较低的层（有时仅允许使用下一个较低的层），而在使用包装器时，外部实体只能看到（并因此依赖）包装器而不能 它包装的内部功能。

* _Refactor_ is a tactic undertaken when two modules are affected by the same change because they are (at least partial) duplicates of each other. Code refactoring is a mainstay practice of Agile development projects, as a cleanup step to make sure that teams have not produced duplicative or overly complex code; however, the concept applies to architectural elements as well. Common responsibilities (and the code that implements them) are “factored out” of the modules where they exist and assigned an appropriate home of their own. By co-locating common responsibilities—that is, making them submodules of the same parent module—the architect can reduce coupling.

  _重构_ 是当两个模块由于彼此（至少是部分）重复而受到相同更改影响时采取的策略。 代码重构是敏捷开发项目的主要实践，它是清理步骤，以确保团队没有产生重复或过于复杂的代码。 但是，该概念也适用于架构元素。 共同职责（以及实现这些职责的代码）是从存在它们的模块中“分解”出来的，并为其分配了适当的位置。 通过共同定位共同的职责（即使它们成为同一父模块的子模块），架构师可以减少耦合。

* _Abstract common services_. In the case where two modules provide notquite-the-same but similar services, it may be cost-effective to implement the services just once in a more general (abstract) form. Any modification to the (common) service would then need to occur just in one place, reducing modification costs. A common way to introduce an abstraction is by parameterizing the description (and implementation) of a module’s activities. The parameters can be as simple as values for key variables or as complex as statements in a specialized language that are subsequently interpreted.

  _抽象公共服务_。 在两个模块提供不尽相同但相似的服务的情况下，以更一般（抽象）的形式实施一次服务可能具有成本效益。 这样，对（公共）服务的任何修改将仅需要在一个地方进行，从而降低了修改成本。 引入抽象的一种常见方法是通过参数化模块活动的描述（和实现）。 参数可以像键变量的值一样简单，也可以像随后解释的专用语言中的语句一样复杂。

**Defer Binding**  **延迟绑定**

Because the work of people is almost always more expensive than the work of computers, letting computers handle a change as much as possible will almost always reduce the cost of making that change. If we design artifacts with built-in flexibility, then exercising that flexibility is usually cheaper than hand-coding a specific change.  

因为人的工作几乎总是比计算机的工作昂贵，所以让计算机尽可能多地处理更改几乎总是会减少进行更改的成本。 如果我们设计具有内置灵活性的工件，那么行使这种灵活性通常比手工编码特定更改要便宜。

Parameters are perhaps the best-known mechanism for introducing flexibility, and that is reminiscent of the abstract common services tactic. A parameterized function f(a, b) is more general than the similar function f(a) that assumes b = 0. When we bind the value of some parameters at a different phase in the life cycle than the one in which we defined the parameters, we are applying the defer binding tactic.  

参数也许是引入灵活性的最著名的机制，这让人想起抽象的公共服务策略。 参数化函数`f(a, b)`比假定`b = 0`的相似函数`f(a)`更通用。当我们将某些参数的值绑定到生命周期中的不同阶段时，我们将其定义为 参数，我们正在应用延迟绑定策略。

In general, the later in the life cycle we can bind values, the better. However, putting the mechanisms in place to facilitate that late binding tends to be more expensive—yet another tradeoff. And so the equation on page 118 comes into play. We want to bind as late as possible, as long as the mechanism that allows it is cost-effective.  

通常，在生命周期中，我们可以绑定值越晚越好。 但是，采用适当的机制来促进后期绑定往往会更加昂贵-但这是另一个折衷方案。 因此，第118页的等式开始起作用。 我们希望绑定尽可能晚，只要允许它具有成本效益的机制即可。

Tactics to bind values at compile time or build time include these:  

在编译时或构建时绑定值的策略包括：

* Component replacement (for example, in a build script or makefile)

  组件替换（例如，在构建脚本或makefile中）

* Compile-time parameterization

  编译时参数化

* Aspects

  方面

Tactics to bind values at deployment time include this:  

在部署时绑定值的策略包括：

* Configuration-time binding

  配置时绑定

Tactics to bind values at startup or initialization time include this:  

在启动或初始化时绑定值的策略包括：

* Resource files

  资源文件

Tactics to bind values at runtime include these:  

在运行时绑定值的策略包括：

* Runtime registration

  运行时注册

* Dynamic lookup (e.g., for services)

  动态查找（例如，服务）

* Interpret parameters

  解释参数

* Startup time binding

  启动时间绑定

* Name servers

  名称服务器

* Plug-ins

  插件

* Publish-subscribe

  发布-订阅

* Shared repositories

  共享存储库

* Polymorphism

  多态性

Separating building a mechanism for modifiability from using the mechanism to make a modification admits the possibility of different stakeholders being involved—one stakeholder (usually a developer) to provide the mechanism and another stakeholder (an installer, for example, or a user) to exercise it later, possibly in a completely different life-cycle phase. Installing a mechanism so that someone else can make a change to the system without having to change any code is sometimes called externalizing the change.

将构建可修改性的机制与使用机制进行修改分开，可以承认可能涉及不同的利益相关者，其中一个利益相关者（通常是开发人员）提供该机制，另一个利益相关者（例如安装程序或用户）可以行使 之后，可能处于完全不同的生命周期阶段。 安装一种机制，使其他人无需更改任何代码即可对系统进行更改，有时称为外部化更改。

Mapping among Architectural Elements | Determine if it is desirable to change the way in which functionality is mapped to computational elements (e.g., processes, threads, processors) at runtime, compile time, design time, or build time.<br>Determine the extent of modifications necessary to accommodate the addition, deletion, or modification of a function or a quality attribute. This might involve a determination of the following, for example:<br><li>Execution dependencies<br><li>Assignment of data to atabases<br><li>Assignment of runtime elements to processes, threads, or processors<br>Ensure that such changes are performed with mechanisms that utilize deferred binding of mapping decisions.
Resource Management | Determine how the addition, deletion, or modification of a responsibility or quality attribute will affect resource usage. This involves, for example:<br><li>Determining what changes might introduce new resources or remove old ones or affect existing resource usage<br><li>Determining what resource limits will change and how<br>Ensure that the resources after the modification are sufficient to meet the system requirements.<br>Encapsulate all resource managers and ensure that the policies implemented by those resource managers are themselves encapsulated and bindings are deferred to the extent possible.
Binding Time | For each change or category of change:<br><li>Determine the latest time at which the change will need to be made.<br><li>Choose a defer-binding mechanism (see Section 7.2) that delivers the appropriate capability at the time chosen.<br><li>Determine the cost of introducing the mechanism and the cost of making changes using the chosen mechanism. Use the equation on page 118 to assess your choice of mechanism.<br><li>Do not introduce so many binding choices that change is impeded because the dependencies among the choices are complex and unknown.
Choice of Technology | Determine what modifications are made easier or harder by your technology choices.<br><li>Will your technology choices help to make, test, and deploy modifications?<br><li>How easy is it to modify your choice of technologies (in case some of these technologies change or become obsolete)?<br>Choose your technologies to support the most likely modifications. For example, an enterprise service bus makes it easier to change how elements are connected but may introduce vendor lock-in.

### 7.4 Summary 小结

Modifiability deals with change and the cost in time or money of making a change, including the extent to which this modification affects other functions or quality attributes.

Changes can be made by developers, installers, or end users, and these changes need to be prepared for. There is a cost of preparing for change as well as a cost of making a change. The modifiability tactics are designed to prepare for subsequent changes.

Tactics to reduce the cost of making a change include making modules smaller, increasing cohesion, and reducing coupling. Deferring binding will also reduce the cost of making a change.

Reducing coupling is a standard category of tactics that includes encapsulating, using an intermediary, restricting dependencies, co-locating related responsibilities, refactoring, and abstracting common services.

Increasing cohesion is another standard tactic that involves separating responsibilities that do not serve the same purpose.

Defer binding is a category of tactics that affect build time, load time, initialization time, or runtime.

### 7.5 For Further Reading 进一步阅读

Serious students of software engineering should read two early papers about designing for modifiability. The first is Edsger Dijkstra’s 1968 paper about the T.H.E. operating system [Dijkstra 68], which is the first paper that talks about designing systems to be layered, and the modifiability benefits it brings. The second is David Parnas’s 1972 paper that introduced the concept of information hiding [Parnas 72]. Parnas prescribed defining modules not by their functionality but by
their ability to internalize the effects of changes.

The tactics that we have presented in this chapter are a variant on those introduced by [Bachmann 07].

Additional tactics for modifiability within the avionics domain can be found in [EOSAN 07], published by the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation.

### 7.6 Discussion Questions 问题讨论

1. Modifiability comes in many flavors and is known by many names. Find one of the IEEE or ISO standards dealing with quality attributes and compile a list of quality attributes that refer to some form of modifiability. Discuss the differences.
2. For each quality attribute that you discovered as a result of the previous question, write a modifiability scenario that expresses it.
3. In a certain metropolitan subway system, the ticket machines accept cash but do not give change. There is a separate machine that dispenses change but does not sell tickets. In an average station there are six or eight ticket machines for every change machine. What modifiability tactics do you see at work in this arrangement? What can you say about availability?
4. For the subway system in the previous question, describe the specific form of modifiability (using a modifiability scenario) that seems to be the aim of arranging the ticket and change machines as described.
5. A wrapper is a common aid to modifiability. A wrapper for a component is the only element allowed to use that component; every other piece of software uses the component’s services by going through the wrapper. The wrapper transforms the data or control information for the component it wraps. For example, a component may expect input using English measures but find itself in a system in which all of the other components produce metric measures. A wrapper could be employed to translate. What modifiability tactics does a wrapper embody?
6. Once an intermediary has been introduced into an architecture, some modules may attempt to circumvent it, either inadvertently (because they are not aware of the intermediary) or intentionally (for performance, for convenience, or out of habit). Discuss some architectural means to prevent inadvertent circumvention of an intermediary.
7. In some projects, deployability is an important quality attribute that measures how easy it is to get a new version of the system into the hands of its users. This might mean a trip to your auto dealer or transmitting updates over the Internet. It also includes the time it takes to install the update once it arrives. In projects that measure deployability separately, should the cost of a modification stop when the new version is ready to ship? Justify your answer.
8. The abstract common services tactic is intended to reduce coupling, but it also might reduce cohesion. Discuss.
9. Identify particular change scenarios for an automatic teller machine. What modifications would you make to your automatic teller machine design to accommodate these changes?

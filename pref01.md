Preface 序
===

*I should have no objection to go over the same 
life from its beginning to the end: requesting only 
the advantage authors have, of correcting in a 
[third] edition the faults of the first [two].*

*我不应该反对从头到尾地过同样的生活：只要求作者具有的优势，在第三版中纠正前两个的错误。*

— Benjamin Franklin

It has been a decade since the publication of the second edition of this book. During that time, the field of software architecture has broadened its focus from being primarily internally oriented—How does one design, evaluate, and document software?—to including external impacts as well—a deeper understanding of the influences on architectures and a deeper understanding of the impact architectures have on the life cycle, organizations, and management.

自本书第二版出版以来已有十年了。 在那段时间里，软件体系结构的领域已从主要面向内部的领域（即如何设计，评估和记录软件？）扩展到包括外部影响在内的更广泛的关注点，从而更深入地了解对体系结构的影响和深刻的理解。 架构对生命周期，组织和管理的影响。

The past ten years have also seen dramatic changes in the types of systems being constructed. Large data, social media, and the cloud are all areas that, at most, were embryonic ten years ago and now are not only mature but extremely influential.

在过去的十年中，正在构建的系统类型也发生了巨大变化。 大数据，社交媒体和云都是至多在十年前才萌芽的领域，而如今它们不仅成熟，而且极具影响力。

We listened to some of the criticisms of the previous editions and have
included much more material on patterns, reorganized the material on quality attributes, and made interoperability a quality attribute worthy of its own chapter. We also provide guidance about how you can generate scenarios and tactics for your own favorite quality attributes.

我们听取了前几版的一些批评，
包括更多有关模式的材料，重新组织了有关质量属性的材料，并使互操作性成为值得其本章讨论的质量属性。 我们还提供有关如何为自己喜欢的质量属性生成方案和策略的指南。

To accommodate this plethora of new material, we had to make difficult choices. In particular, this edition of the book does not include extended case studies as the prior editions did. This decision also reflects the maturing of the field, in the sense that case studies about the choices made in software architectures are more prevalent than they were ten years ago, and they are less necessary to convince readers of the importance of software architecture. The case studies from the first two editions are available, however, on the book’s website, at [www.informit.com/title/9780321815736](www.informit.com/title/9780321815736). In addition, on the same website, we have slides that will assist instructors in presenting this material.

为了适应过多的新材料，我们不得不做出艰难的选择。 特别是，这本书的版本不像以前的版本那样包含扩展的案例研究。 这一决定还反映了该领域的成熟，从某种意义上讲，与10年前相比，有关软件体系结构选择的案例研究更为普遍，并且对于使读者相信软件体系结构的重要性而言，它们的必要性也较小。 本书网站上提供了前两个版本的案例研究，网址为[www.informit.com/title/9780321815736](www.informit.com/title/9780321815736)。 此外，在同一网站上，我们有幻灯片可帮助讲师介绍此材料。

We have thoroughly reworked many of the topics covered in this edition. In particular, we realize that the methods we present—for architecture design, analysis, and documentation—are one version of how to achieve a particular goal, but there are others. This led us to separate the methods that we present in detail from their underlying theory. We now present the theory first with specific methods given as illustrations of possible realizations of the theories. The new topics in this edition include architecture-centric project management; architecture competence; requirements modeling and analysis; Agile methods; implementation and testing; the cloud; and the edge.

我们已经彻底修改了此版本中涉及的许多主题。 特别是，我们意识到我们介绍的方法（用于体系结构设计，分析和文档编制）是实现特定目标的一种方式，但还有其他方式。 这导致我们将我们详细介绍的方法从其基础理论中分离出来。 现在，我们首先用特定的方法介绍该理论，以举例说明该理论的可能实现。 此版本中的新主题包括以架构为中心的项目管理； 建筑能力； 需求建模和分析； 敏捷方法； 实施和测试； 云端; 和边缘。

As with the prior editions, we firmly believe that the topics are best discussed in either reading groups or in classroom settings, and to that end we have included a collection of discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Most of these questions are open-ended, with no absolute right or wrong answers, so you, as a reader, should emphasize how you justify your answer rather than just answer the question itself.

与以前的版本一样，我们坚信最好在阅读小组或课堂环境中讨论主题，为此，我们在每章末尾都包含了一系列讨论问题。 这些问题大多数都是开放式的，没有绝对正确或错误的答案，因此，作为读者，您应该强调如何证明自己的答案，而不是仅仅回答问题本身。

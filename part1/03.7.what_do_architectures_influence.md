3.7 What Do Architectures Influence? 架构影响什么？
===

The story about contexts influencing architectures has a flip side. It turns out that architectures have an influence on the very factors that influence them. Specifically, the existence of an architecture affects the technical, project, business, and professional contexts that subsequently influence future architectures.

Here is how the cycle works:

* _Technical context_. The architecture can affect stakeholder requirements for the next system by giving the customer the opportunity to receive a system (based on the same architecture) in a more reliable, timely, and economical manner than if the subsequent system were to be built from scratch, and typically with fewer defects. A customer may in fact be willing to relax some of their requirements to gain these economies. Shrinkwrapped software has clearly affected people’s requirements by providing solutions that are not tailored to any individual’s precise needs but are instead inexpensive and (in the best of all possible worlds) of high quality. Software product lines have the same effect on customers who cannot be so flexible with their requirements.
* Project context. The architecture affects the structure of the developing organization. An architecture prescribes a structure for a system; as we will see, it particularly prescribes the units of software that must be implemented (or otherwise obtained) and integrated to form the system. These units are the basis for the development project’s structure. Teams are formed for individual software units; and the development, test, and integration activities all revolve around the units. Likewise, schedules and budgets allocate resources in chunks corresponding to the units. If a company becomes adept at building families of similar systems, it will tend to invest in each team by nurturing each area of expertise. Teams become embedded in the organization’s structure. This is feedback from the architecture to the developing organization. In any design undertaken by the organization at large, these groups have a strong voice in the system’s decomposition, pressuring for the continued existence of the portions they control.
* Business context. The architecture can affect the business goals of the developing organization. A successful system built from an architecture can enable a company to establish a foothold in a particular market segment—think of the iPhone or Android app platforms as examples. The architecture can provide opportunities for the efficient production and deployment of similar systems, and the organization may adjust its goals to take advantage of its newfound expertise to plumb the market. This is feedback from the system to the developing organization and the systems it builds.
* Professional context. The process of system building will affect the architect’s experience with subsequent systems by adding to the corporate experience base. A system that was successfully built around a particular technical approach will make the architect more inclined to build systems using the same approach in the future. On the other hand, architectures that fail are less likely to be chosen for future projects.

These and other feedback mechanisms form what we call the Architecture Influence Cycle, or AIC, illustrated in Figure 3.5, which depicts the influences of the culture and business of the development organization on the software architecture. That architecture is, in turn, a primary determinant of the properties of the developed system or systems. But the AIC is also based on a recognition that shrewd organizations can take advantage of the organizational and experiential effects of developing an architecture and can use those effects to position their business strategically for future projects.

2.8 Enabling Evolutionary Prototyping 支持进化原型
===

Once an architecture has been defined, it can be analyzed and prototyped as a skeletal system. A skeletal system is one in which at least some of the infrastructure—how the elements initialize, communicate, share data, access resources, report errors, log activity, and so forth—is built before much of the system’s functionality has been created. (The two can go hand in hand: build a little infrastructure to support a little end-to-end functionality; repeat until done.)

For example, systems built as plug-in architectures are skeletal systems: the plug-ins provide the actual functionality. This approach aids the development process because the system is executable early in the product’s life cycle. The fidelity of the system increases as stubs are instantiated, or prototype parts are replaced with complete versions of these parts of the software. In some cases the prototype parts can be low-fidelity versions of the final functionality, or they can be surrogates that consume and produce data at the appropriate rates but do little else. Among other things, this approach allows potential performance problems to be identified early in the product’s life cycle.

These benefits reduce the potential risk in the project. Furthermore, if the architecture is part of a family of related systems, the cost of creating a framework for prototyping can be distributed over the development of many systems.

2.6 Defining Constraints on an Implementation
===

An implementation exhibits an architecture if it conforms to the design decisions prescribed by the architecture. This means that the implementation must be implemented as the set of prescribed elements, these elements must interact with each other in the prescribed fashion, and each element must fulfill its responsibility to the other elements as dictated by the architecture. Each of these prescriptions is a constraint on the implementer.

Element builders must be fluent in the specifications of their individual elements, but they may not be aware of the architectural tradeoffs—the architecture (or architect) simply constrains them in such a way as to meet the tradeoffs. A classic example of this phenomenon is when an architect assigns performance budget to the pieces of software involved in some larger piece of functionality. If each software unit stays within its budget, the overall transaction will meet its performance requirement. Implementers of each of the constituent pieces may not know the overall budget, only their own.

Conversely, the architects need not be experts in all aspects of algorithm design or the intricacies of the programming language—although they should certainly know enough not to design something that is difficult to build—but they are the ones responsible for establishing, analyzing, and enforcing the architectural tradeoffs.

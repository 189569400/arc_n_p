3 The Many Context of Software Architecture 一些软件架构的上下文
===

_People in London think of London as the center of the world, whereas New Yorkers think the world ends three miles outside of Manhattan._  
—Toby Young

In 1976, a New Yorker magazine cover featured a cartoon by Saul Steinberg showing a New Yorker’s view of the world. You’ve probably seen it; if not, you can easily find it online. Looking to the west from 9th Avenue in Manhattan, the illustration shows 10th Avenue, then the wide Hudson River, then a thin strip of completely nondescript land called “Jersey,” followed by a somewhat thicker strip of land representing the entire rest of the United States. The mostly empty United States has a cartoon mountain or two here and there and a few cities haphazardly placed “out there,” and is flanked by featureless “Canada” on the right and “Mexico” on the left. Beyond is the Pacific Ocean, only slightly wider than the Hudson, and beyond that lie tiny amorphous shapes for Japan and China and Russia, and that’s pretty much the world from a New Yorker’s perspective.

1976年，《纽约客》杂志的封面刊登了绍尔·斯坦伯格的漫画，展示了纽约客的世界观。 您可能已经看过了； 如果没有，您可以在网上轻松找到它。 从曼哈顿的第9大道向西看，插图显示了第10大道，然后是宽阔的哈德逊河，然后是一小段完全描述不清的土地，称为“泽西岛”，其后是一条较厚的土地，代表了整个美国 状态。 大部分为空旷的美国在这里和那里到处都有一两座卡通山，还有一些城市随意地放置在“外面”，右边是无特色的“加拿大”，左边是“墨西哥”。 太平洋之外，仅比哈德逊河略宽，而太平洋之外则是日本，中国和俄罗斯的微小无定形形状，从纽约客的角度来看，这几乎就是整个世界。

In a book about architecture, it is tempting to view architecture in the same way, as the most important piece of the software universe. And in some chapters, we unapologetically will do exactly that. But in this chapter we put software architecture in its place, showing how it supports and is informed by other critical forces and activities in the various contexts in which it plays a role.

在关于架构的书中，试图以与软件领域最重要的部分相同的方式来查看架构是很诱人的。 在某些章节中，我们将毫无保留地做到这一点。 但是在本章中，我们将软件架构放到了它的位置，显示了软件架构如何在其发挥作用的各种上下文中支持其他关键力量和活动并从中获悉。

These contexts, around which we structured this book, are as follows:

我们围绕这些上下文构建了本书，内容如下：

* _Technical_. What technical role does the software architecture play in the system or systems of which it’s a part?
* _技术_。 软件架构在组成其一部分的系统中起什么技术作用？
* _Project life cycle_. How does a software architecture relate to the other phases of a software development life cycle?
* _项目生命周期_。 软件架构与软件开发生命周期的其他阶段如何相关？
* _Business_. How does the presence of a software architecture affect an organization’s business environment?
* _业务_。 软件架构的存在如何影响组织的业务环境？
* _Professional_. What is the role of a software architect in an organization or a development project?
* 专业的。 软件架构师在组织或开发项目中的作用是什么？

These contexts all play out throughout the book, but this chapter introduces each one. Although the contexts are unchanging, the specifics for your system may change over time. One challenge for the architect is to envision what in their context might change and to adopt mechanisms to protect the system and its development if the envisioned changes come to pass.

这些内容在整本书中都有介绍，但本章将逐一介绍。 尽管上下文不变，但系统的详细信息可能会随时间而变化。 架构师面临的一项挑战是，预见其上下文中可能发生的变化，并采用机制来保护系统及其开发（如果预想的更改得以通过）。

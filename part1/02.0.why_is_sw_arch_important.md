2 Why Is Software Architecture Important?为什么说软件构架非常重要？
===

_Software architecture is the set of design decisions which, if made incorrectly, may cause your project to be cancelled._  
—Eoin Woods

If architecture is the answer, what was the question?

如果架构是答案，那么问题是什么？

While Chapter 3 will cover the business importance of architecture to an enterprise, this chapter focuses on why architecture matters from a technical perspective. We will examine a baker’s dozen of the most important reasons.

尽管第3章将介绍架构对企业的业务重要性，但本章着重从技术角度着眼于为何架构很重要。 我们将研究面包师的十个最重要的原因。

1. An architecture will inhibit or enable a system’s driving quality attributes.  
1.架构将禁止或启用系统的行驶质量属性。
2. The decisions made in an architecture allow you to reason about and manage change as the system evolves.  
2.在架构中做出的决定使您能够推理和管理随着系统发展而发生的变化。
3. The analysis of an architecture enables early prediction of a system’s qualities.  
3.对架构的分析可以及早预测系统的质量。
4. A documented architecture enhances communication among stakeholders.  
4.有文档记录的架构可增进利益相关者之间的沟通。
5. The architecture is a carrier of the earliest and hence most fundamental, hardest-to-change design decisions.  
5.架构是最早，因此也是最基本，最难更改的设计决策的载体。
6. An architecture defines a set of constraints on subsequent implementation.  
6.架构定义了一组对后续实现的约束。
7. The architecture dictates the structure of an organization, or vice versa.  
7.架构决定了组织的结构，反之亦然。
8. An architecture can provide the basis for evolutionary prototyping.  
8.架构可以为原型的演进提供基础。
9. An architecture is the key artifact that allows the architect and project manager to reason about cost and schedule.  
9.架构是关键的工件，它使架构师和项目经理可以推断成本和进度。
10. An architecture can be created as a transferable, reusable model that forms the heart of a product line.  
10.可以将架构创建为构成产品线核心的可转让、可重用模型。
11. Architecture-based development focuses attention on the assembly of components, rather than simply on their creation.  
11.基于架构的开发将注意力集中在组件的组装上，而不是仅仅关注它们的创建。
12. By restricting design alternatives, architecture channels the creativity of developers, reducing design and system complexity.  
12.通过限制设计替代方案，架构引导开发人员的创造力，降低了设计和系统的复杂性。
13. An architecture can be the foundation for training a new team member.  
13.架构可以成为培训新团队成员的基础。

Even if you already believe us that architecture is important and don’t need the point hammered thirteen more times, think of these thirteen points (which form the outline for this chapter) as thirteen useful ways to use architecture in a project.

即使您已经相信我们的架构很重要并且不需要再反复强调13次，也可以将这13点（构成本章的大纲）视为在项目中使用架构的13种有用方法。

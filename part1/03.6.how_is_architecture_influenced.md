3.6 How Is Architecture Influenced? 架构是如何受到影响的？
===

For decades, software designers have been taught to build systems based on the software’s technical requirements. In the older Waterfall model, the requirements document is “tossed over the wall” into the designer’s cubicle, and the designer must come forth with a satisfactory design. Requirements beget design, which begets system. In an iterative or Agile approach to development, an increment of requirements begets an increment of design, and so forth.

This vision of software development is short-sighted. In any development effort, the requirements make explicit some—but only some—of the desired properties of the final system. Not all requirements are focused directly on desired system properties; some requirements might mandate a development process or the use of a particular tool. Furthermore, the requirements specification only begins to tell the story. Failure to satisfy other constraints may render the system just as problematic as if it functioned poorly.

What do you suppose would happen if two different architects, working in two different organizations, were given the same requirements specification for a system? Do you think they would produce the same architecture or different ones?

The answer is that they would very likely produce different ones, which immediately belies the notion that requirements determine architecture. Other factors are at work.

A software architecture is a result of business and social influences, as well as technical ones. The existence of an architecture in turn affects the technical, business, and social environments that subsequently influence future architectures. In particular, each of the contexts for architecture that we just covered—technical, project, business, and professional—plays a role in influencing an architect and the architecture, as shown in Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.4 Influences on the architect

An architect designing a system for which the real-time deadlines are tight will make one set of design choices; the same architect, designing a similar system in which the deadlines can be easily satisfied, will make different choices. And the same architect, designing a non-real-time system, is likely to make quite different choices still. Even with the same requirements, hardware, support software, and human resources available, an architect designing a system today is likely to design a different system than might have been designed five years ago.

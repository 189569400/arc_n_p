Rebecca Grinter has observed architects from a sociological standpoint. In [Grinter 99] she argues eloquently that the architect’s primary role is to facilitate stakeholder communication. The way she puts it is that architects enable communication among parties who would otherwise not be able to talk to each other.

The granddaddy of papers about architecture and organization is [Conway 68]. Conway’s law states that “organizations which design systems . . . are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”

There is much about software development through composition that remains unresolved. When the components that are candidates for importation and reuse are distinct subsystems that have been built with conflicting architectural assumptions, unanticipated complications can increase the effort required to integrate their functions. David Garlan and his colleagues coined the term architectural mismatch to describe this situation, and their paper on it is worth reading [Garlan 95].

Paulish [Paulish 02] discusses architecture-based project management, and in particular the ways in which an architecture can help in the estimation of project cost and schedule.

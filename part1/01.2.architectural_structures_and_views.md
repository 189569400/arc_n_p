1.2 Architectural Structures and Views 架构结构和视图
===

The neurologist, the orthopedist, the hematologist, and the dermatologist all have different views of the structure of a human body. Ophthalmologists, cardiologists, and podiatrists concentrate on specific subsystems. And the kinesiologist and psychiatrist are concerned with different aspects of the entire arrangement’s behavior. Although these views are pictured differently and have very different properties, all are inherently related, interconnected: together they describe the architecture of the human body. Figure 1.1 shows several different views of the human body: the skeletal, the vascular, and the X-ray.

So it is with software. Modern systems are frequently too complex to grasp all at once. Instead, we restrict our attention at any one moment to one (or a small number) of the software system’s structures. To communicate meaningfully about an architecture, we must make clear which structure or structures we are discussing at the moment—which view we are taking of the architecture.

**Structures and Views**

We will be using the related terms structure and view when discussing architecture representation.

* A view is a representation of a coherent set of architectural elements, as written by and read by system stakeholders. It consists of a representation of a set of elements and the relations among them.
* A structure is the set of elements itself, as they exist in software or hardware.

In short, a view is a representation of a structure. For example, a module structure is the set of the system’s modules and their organization. A module view is the representation of that structure, documented according to a template in a chosen notation, and used by some system stakeholders.

So: Architects design structures. They document views of those structures.

**Three Kinds of Structures**

As we saw in the previous section, architectural structures can be divided into three major categories, depending on the broad nature of the elements they show. These correspond to the three broad kinds of decisions that architectural design involves:

1. Module structures embody decisions as to how the system is to be structured as a set of code or data units that have to be constructed or procured. In any module structure, the elements are modules of some kind (perhaps classes, or layers, or merely divisions of functionality, all of which are units of implementation). Modules represent a static way of considering the system. Modules are assigned areas of functional responsibility; there is less emphasis in these structures on how the resulting software manifests itself at runtime. Module structures allow us to answer questions such as these:
  * What is the primary functional responsibility assigned to each module?
  * What other software elements is a module allowed to use?
  * What other software does it actually use and depend on?
  * What modules are related to other modules by generalization or specialization (i.e., inheritance) relationships?  
Module structures convey this information directly, but they can also be used by extension to ask questions about the impact on the system when the responsibilities assigned to each module change. In other words, examining a system’s module structures—that is, looking at its module views—is an excellent way to reason about a system’s modifiability.
2. Component-and-connector structures embody decisions as to how the system is to be structured as a set of elements that have runtime behavior (components) and interactions (connectors). In these structures, the elements are runtime components (which are the principal units of computation and could be services, peers, clients, servers, filters, or many other types of runtime elements) and connectors (which are the communication vehicles among components, such as call-return, process synchronization operators, pipes, or others). Component-and-connector views help us answer questions such as these:
  * What are the major executing components and how do they interact at runtime?
  * What are the major shared data stores?
  * Which parts of the system are replicated?
  * How does data progress through the system?
  * What parts of the system can run in parallel?
  * Can the system’s structure change as it executes and, if so, how?  
By extension, component-and-connector views are crucially important for asking questions about the system’s runtime properties such as performance, security, availability, and more.
3. Allocation structures embody decisions as to how the system will relate to nonsoftware structures in its environment (such as CPUs, file systems, networks, development teams, etc.). These structures show the relationship between the software elements and elements in one or more external environments in which the software is created and executed. Allocation views help us answer questions such as these:
  * What processor does each software element execute on?
  * In what directories or files is each element stored during development, testing, and system building?
  * What is the assignment of each software element to development teams? 

**Structures Provide Insight**

Structures play such an important role in our perspective on software architecture because of the analytical and engineering power they hold. Each structure provides a perspective for reasoning about some of the relevant quality attributes. For example:
* The module “uses” structure, which embodies what modules use what other modules, is strongly tied to the ease with which a system can be extended or contracted.
* The concurrency structure, which embodies parallelism within the system, is strongly tied to the ease with which a system can be made free of deadlock and performance bottlenecks.
* The deployment structure is strongly tied to the achievement of performance, availability, and security goals.

And so forth. Each structure provides the architect with a different insight into the design (that is, each structure can be analyzed for its ability to deliver a quality attribute). But perhaps more important, each structure presents the architect with an engineering leverage point: By designing the structures appropriately, the desired quality attributes emerge.

Scenarios, described in Chapter 4, are useful for exercising a given structure as well as its connections to other structures. For example, a software engineer wanting to make a change to the concurrency structure of a system would need to consult the concurrency and deployment views, because the affected mechanisms typically involve processes and threads, and physical distribution might involve different control mechanisms than would be used if the processes were co-located on a single machine. If control mechanisms need to be changed, the module decomposition would need to be consulted to determine the extent of the changes.

**Some Useful Module Structures**

Useful module structures include the following:

* _Decomposition structure_. The units are modules that are related to each other by the is-a-submodule-of relation, showing how modules are decomposed into smaller modules recursively until the modules are small enough to be easily understood. Modules in this structure represent a common starting point for design, as the architect enumerates what the units of software will have to do and assigns each item to a module for subsequent (more detailed) design and eventual implementation. Modules often have products (such as interface specifications, code, test plans, etc.) associated with them. The decomposition structure determines, to a large degree, the system’s modifiability, by assuring that likely changes are localized. That is, changes fall within the purview of at most a few (preferably small) modules. This structure is often used as the basis for the development project’s organization, including the structure of the documentation, and the project’s integration and test plans. The units in this structure tend to have names that are organization-specific such as “segment” or “subsystem.”
* _Uses structure_. In this important but overlooked structure, the units here are also modules, perhaps classes. The units are related by the uses relation, a specialized form of dependency. A unit of software uses another if the correctness of the first requires the presence of a correctly functioning version (as opposed to a stub) of the second. The uses structure is used to engineer systems that can be extended to add functionality, or from which useful functional subsets can be extracted. The ability to easily create a subset of a system allows for incremental development.
* _Layer structure_. The modules in this structure are called layers. A layer is an abstract “virtual machine” that provides a cohesive set of services through a managed interface. Layers are allowed to use other layers in a strictly managed fashion; in strictly layered systems, a layer is only allowed to use the layer immediately below. This structure is used to imbue a system with portability, the ability to change the underlying computing platform.
* _Class (or generalization) structure_. The module units in this structure are called classes. The relation is inherits from or is an instance of. This view supports reasoning about collections of similar behavior or capability (e.g., the classes that other classes inherit from) and parameterized differences. The class structure allows one to reason about reuse and the incremental addition of functionality. If any documentation exists for a project that has followed an object-oriented analysis and design process, it is typically this structure.
* _Data model_. The data model describes the static information structure in terms of data entities and their relationships. For example, in a banking system, entities will typically include Account, Customer, and Loan. Account has several attributes, such as account number, type (savings or checking), status, and current balance. A relationship may dictate that one customer can have one or more accounts, and one account is associated to one or two customers.

**Some Useful C&C Structures**

Component-and-connector structures show a runtime view of the system. In these structures the modules described above have all been compiled into executable forms. All component-and-connector structures are thus orthogonal to the module-based structures and deal with the dynamic aspects of a running system. The relation in all component-and-connector structures is attachment, showing how the components and the connectors are hooked together. (The connectors themselves can be familiar constructs such as “invokes.”) Useful C&C structures include the following:

* _Service structure_. The units here are services that interoperate with each other by service coordination mechanisms such as SOAP (see Chapter 6). The service structure is an important structure to help engineer a system composed of components that may have been developed anonymously and independently of each other.
* _Concurrency structure_. This component-and-connector structure allows the architect to determine opportunities for parallelism and the locations where resource contention may occur. The units are components and the connectors are their communication mechanisms. The components are arranged into logical threads; a logical thread is a sequence of computations that could be allocated to a separate physical thread later in the design process. The concurrency structure is used early in the design process to identify the requirements to manage the issues associated with concurrent execution.

**Some Useful Allocation Structures**

Allocation structures define how the elements from C&C or module structures map onto things that are not software: typically hardware, teams, and file systems. Useful allocation structures include these:

* _Deployment structure_. The deployment structure shows how software is assigned to hardware processing and communication elements. The elements are software elements (usually a process from a C&C view), hardware entities (processors), and communication pathways. Relations are allocated-to, showing on which physical units the software elements reside, and migrates-to if the allocation is dynamic. This structure can be used to reason about performance, data integrity, security, and availability. It is of particular interest in distributed and parallel systems.
* _Implementation structure_. This structure shows how software elements (usually modules) are mapped to the file structure(s) in the system’s development, integration, or configuration control environments. This is critical for the management of development activities and build processes. (In practice, a screenshot of your development environment tool, which manages the implementation environment, often makes a very useful and sufficient diagram of your implementation view.)
* _Work assignment structure_. This structure assigns responsibility for implementing and integrating the modules to the teams who will carry it out. Having a work assignment structure be part of the architecture makes it clear that the decision about who does the work has architectural as well as management implications. The architect will know the expertise required on each team. Also, on large multi-sourced distributed development projects, the work assignment structure is the means for calling out units of functional commonality and assigning those to a single team, rather than having them implemented by everyone who needs them. This structure will also determine the major communication pathways among the teams: regular teleconferences, wikis, email lists, and so forth.

Table 1.1 summarizes these structures. The table lists the meaning of the elements and relations in each structure and tells what each might be used for.

**Relating Structures to Each Other**

Each of these structures provides a different perspective and design handle on a system, and each is valid and useful in its own right. Although the structures give different system perspectives, they are not independent. Elements of one structure will be related to elements of other structures, and we need to reason about these relations. For example, a module in a decomposition structure may be manifested as one, part of one, or several components in one of the component-and-connector structures, reflecting its runtime alter ego. In general, mappings between structures are many to many.

Figure 1.2 shows a very simple example of how two structures might relate to each other. The figure on the left shows a module decomposition view of a tiny client-server system. In this system, two modules must be implemented: The client software and the server software. The figure on the right shows a component-and-connector view of the same system. At runtime there are ten clients running and accessing the server. Thus, this little system has two modules and eleven components (and ten connectors).

Whereas the correspondence between the elements in the decomposition structure and the client-server structure is obvious, these two views are used for very different things. For example, the view on the right could be used for performance analysis, bottleneck prediction, and network traffic management, which would be extremely difficult or impossible to do with the view on the left.

(In Chapter 13 we’ll learn about the map-reduce pattern, in which copies of simple, identical functionality are distributed across hundreds or thousands of processing nodes—one module for the whole system, but one component per node.)

Individual projects sometimes consider one structure dominant and cast other structures, when possible, in terms of the dominant structure. Often the dominant structure is the module decomposition structure. This is for a good reason: it tends to spawn the project structure, because it mirrors the team structure of development. In other projects, the dominant structure might be a C&C structure that shows how the system’s functionality and/or critical quality attributes are achieved.

**Fewer Is Better**

Not all systems warrant consideration of many architectural structures. The larger the system, the more dramatic the difference between these structures tends to be; but for small systems we can often get by with fewer. Instead of working with each of several component-and-connector structures, usually a single one will do. If there is only one process, then the process structure collapses to a single node and need not be explicitly represented in the design. If there is to be no distribution (that is, if the system is implemented on a single processor), then the deployment structure is trivial and need not be considered further. In general, design and document a structure only if doing so brings a positive return on the investment, usually in terms of decreased development or maintenance costs.

**Which Structures to Choose?**

We have briefly described a number of useful architectural structures, and there are many more. Which ones shall an architect choose to work on? Which ones shall the architect choose to document? Surely not all of them. Chapter 18 will treat this topic in more depth, but for now a good answer is that you should think about how the various structures available to you provide insight and leverage into the system’s most important quality attributes, and then choose the ones that will play the best role in delivering those attributes.

> More than a decade ago I went to a customer site to do an architecture evaluation—one of the first instances of the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) that I had ever performed (you can read about the ATAM, and other architecture evaluation topics, in Chapter 21). In those early days, we were still figuring out how to make architecture evaluations repeatable and predictable, and how to guarantee useful outcomes from them. One of the ways that we ensured useful outcomes was to enforce certain preconditions on the evaluation. A precondition that we figured out rather quickly was this: if the architecture has not been documented, we will not proceed with the evaluation. The reason for this precondition was simple: we could not evaluate the architecture by reading the code—we didn’t have the time for that—and we couldn’t just ask the architect to sketch the architecture in real time, since that would produce vague and very likely erroneous representations.
>
> Okay, it’s not completely true to say that they had no architecture documentation. They did produce a single-page diagram, with a few boxes and lines. Some of those boxes were, however, clouds. Yes, they actually used a cloud as one of their icons. When I pressed them on the meaning of this icon—Was it a process? A class? A thread?—they waffled. This was not, in fact, architecture documentation. It was, at best, “marketecture.”
>
> But in those early days we had no preconditions and so we didn’t stop the evaluation there. We just blithely waded in to whatever swamp we found, and we enforced nothing. As I began this evaluation, I interviewed some of the key project stakeholders: the project manager and several of the architects (this was a large project with one lead architect and several subordinates). As it happens, the lead architect was away, and so I spent my time with the subordinate architects. Every time I asked the subordinates a tough question—“How do you ensure that you will meet your latency goal along this critical execution path?” or “What are your rules for layering?”—they would answer: “Ask Cal. Cal knows that.” Cal was the lead architect. Immediately I noted a risk for this system: What if Cal gets hit by a bus? What then?
>
> In the end, because of my pestering, the architecture team did in fact produce respectable architecture documentation. About halfway through the evaluation, the project manager came up to me and shook my hand and thanked me for the great job I had done. I was dumbstruck. In my mind I hadn’t done anything, at that point; the evaluation was only partially complete and I hadn’t produced a single report or finding. I said that to the manager and he said: “You got those guys to document the architecture. I’ve never been able to get them to do that. So . . . thanks!”
>
> If Cal had been hit by a bus or just left the company, they would have had a serious problem on their hands: all of that architectural knowledge located in one guy’s head and he is no longer with the organization. In can happen. It does happen.
>
> The moral of this story? An architecture that is not documented, and not communicated, may still be a good architecture, but the risks surrounding it are enormous.

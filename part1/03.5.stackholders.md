3.5 Stakeholders
===

Many people and organizations are interested in a software system. We call these entities stakeholders. A stakeholder is anyone who has a stake in the success of the system: the customer, the end users, the developers, the project manager, the maintainers, and even those who market the system, for example. But stakeholders, despite all having a shared stake in the success of the system, typically have different specific concerns that they wish the system to guarantee or optimize. These concerns are as diverse as providing a certain behavior at runtime, performing well on a particular piece of hardware, being easy to customize, achieving short time to market or low cost of development, gainfully employing programmers who have a particular specialty, or providing a broad range of functions. Figure 3.3 shows the architect receiving a few helpful stakeholder “suggestions.”

You will need to know and understand the nature, source, and priority of constraints on the project as early as possible. Therefore, you must identify and actively engage the stakeholders to solicit their needs and expectations. Early engagement of stakeholders allows you to understand the constraints of the task, manage expectations, negotiate priorities, and make tradeoffs. Architecture evaluation (covered in Part III of this book) and iterative prototyping are two means for you to achieve stakeholder engagement.

Having an acceptable system involves appropriate performance, reliability, availability, platform compatibility, memory utilization, network usage, security, modifiability, usability, and interoperability with other systems as well as behavior. All of these qualities, and others, affect how the delivered system is viewed by its eventual recipients, and so such quality attributes will be demanded by one or more of the system’s stakeholders.

The underlying problem, of course, is that each stakeholder has different concerns and goals, some of which may be contradictory. It is a rare requirements document that does a good job of capturing all of a system’s quality requirements in testable detail (a property is testable if it is falsifiable; “make the system easy to use” is not falsifiable but “deliver audio packets with no more than 10 ms. jitter” is falsifiable). The architect often has to fill in the blanks—the quality attribute requirements that have not been explicitly stated—and mediate the conflicts that frequently emerge.

Therefore, one of the best pieces of advice we can give to architects is this: Know your stakeholders. Talk to them, engage them, listen to them, and put yourself in their shoes. Table 3.1 enumerates a set of stakeholders. Notice the remarkable variety and length of this set, but remember that not every stakeholder named in this list may play a role in every system, and one person may play many roles.

# Table 3.1 Stakeholders for a System and Their Interests
Name | Description | Interest in Architecture
--|--|--
Analyst | Responsible for analyzing the architecture to make sure it meets certain critical quality attribute requirements. Analysts are often specialized; for instance, performance analysts, safety analysts, and security analysts may have well-defined positions in a project. | Analyzing satisfaction of quality attribute requirements of the system based on its architecture.
Architect | Responsible for the development of the architecture and its documentation. Focus and responsibility is on the system. | Negotiating and making tradeoffs among competing requirements and design approaches. A vessel for recording design decisions. Providing evidence that the architecture satisfies its requirements.
Business Manager | Responsible for the functioning of the business/organizational entity that owns the system. Includes managerial/executive responsibility, responsibility for defining business processes, etc. | Understanding the ability of the architecture to meet business goals.
Conformance Checker | Responsible for assuring conformance to standards and processes to provide confidence in a product’s suitability. | Basis for conformance checking, for assurance that implementations have been faithful to the architectural prescriptions.
Customer | Pays for the system and ensures its delivery. The customer often speaks for or represents the end user, especially in a government acquisition context. | Assuring required functionality and quality will be delivered; gauging progress; estimating cost; and setting expectations for what will be delivered, when, and for how much.
Database Administrator | Involved in many aspects of the data stores, including database design, data analysis, data modeling and optimization, installation of database software, and monitoring and administration of database security. | Understanding how data is created, used, and updated by other architectural elements, and what properties the data and database must have for the overall system to meet its quality goals.
Deployer | Responsible for accepting the completed system from the development effort and deploying it, making it operational, and fulfilling its allocated business function. | Understanding the architectural elements that are delivered and to be installed at the customer or end user’s site, and their overall responsibility toward system function.
Designer | Responsible for systems and/or software design downstream of the architecture, applying the architecture to meet specific requirements of the parts for which they are responsible. | Resolving resource contention and establishing performance and other kinds of runtime resource consumption budgets. Understanding how their part will communicate and interact with other parts of the system.
Evaluator | Responsible for conducting a formal evaluation of the architecture (and its documentation) against some clearly defined criteria. | Evaluating the architecture’s ability to deliver required behavior and quality attributes.

---

Name | Description | Interest in Architecture
--|--|--
Implementer | Responsible for the development of specific elements according to designs, requirements, and the architecture. | Understanding inviolable constraints and exploitable freedoms on development activities.
Integrator | Responsible for taking individual components and integrating them, according to the architecture and system designs. | Producing integration plans and procedures, and locating the source of integration failures.
Maintainer | Responsible for fixing bugs and providing enhancements to the system throughout its life (including adaptation of the system for uses not originally envisioned). | Understanding the ramifications of a change.
Network Administrator | Responsible for the maintenance and oversight of computer hardware and software in a computer network. This may include the deployment, configuration, maintenance, and monitoring of network components. | Determining network loads during various use profiles, understanding uses of the network.
Product-Line Manager | Responsible for development of an entire family of products, all built using the same core assets (including the architecture). | Determining whether a potential new member of a product family is in or out of scope and, if out, by how much.
Project Manager | Responsible for planning, sequencing, scheduling, and allocating resources to develop software components and deliver components to integration and test activities. | Helping to set budget and schedule, gauging progress against established budget and schedule, identifying and resolving development-time resource contention.
Representative of External Systems | Responsible for managing a system with which this one must interoperate, and its interface with our system. | Defining the set of agreement between the systems.
System Engineer | Responsible for design and development of systems or system components in which software plays a role. | Assuring that the system environment provided for the software is sufficient.
Tester | Responsible for the (independent) test and verification of the system or its elements against the formal requirements and the architecture. | Creating tests based on the behavior and interaction of the software elements.
User | The actual end users of the system. There may be distinguished kinds of users, such as administrators, superusers, etc. | Users, in the role of reviewers, might use architecture documentation to check whether desired functionality is being delivered. Users might also use the documentation to understand what the major system elements are, which can aid them in emergency field maintenance.

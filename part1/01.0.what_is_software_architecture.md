_Good judgment is usually the result of experience. And experience is frequently the result of bad judgment. But to learn from the experience of others requires those who have the experience to share the knowledge with those who follow._

_良好的判断通常是经验的结果。经验往往是错误判断的结果。但要从他人的经验中学习，需要有经验的人与跟随者分享知识。_

—Barry LePatner

Writing (on our part) and reading (on your part) a book about software architecture, which distills the experience of many people, presupposes that

编写（就我们而言）和（就您而言）阅读一本有关软件架构的书，该书提炼了许多人的经验，其前提是

1. having a software architecture is important to the successful development of a software system and  
1.具有软件架构对于软件系统的成功开发很重要，并且
2. there is a sufficient, and sufficiently generalizable, body of knowledge about software architecture to fill up a book.  
2.关于软件架构，有足够的知识和可广泛推广的知识，可以用来填一本书。

One purpose of this book is to convince you that both of these assumptions are true, and once you are convinced, give you a basic knowledge so that you can apply it yourself.

本书的目的之一是说服您这两个假设都是正确的，一旦您确信了这点，就给您基础知识，以便您可以自己应用。

Software systems are constructed to satisfy organizations’ business goals. The architecture is a bridge between those (often abstract) business goals and the final (concrete) resulting system. While the path from abstract goals to concrete systems can be complex, the good news is that software architectures can be designed, analyzed, documented, and implemented using known techniques that will support the achievement of these business and mission goals. The complexity can be tamed, made tractable.

构建软件系统是为了满足组织的业务目标。架构是那些（通常是抽象的）业务目标和最终的（具体的）最终系统之间的桥梁。 尽管从抽象目标到具体系统的路径可能很复杂，但令人欣慰的是，可以使用支持实现这些业务和任务目标的已知技术来设计、分析、记录和实施软件架构。 可以驯服复杂性，使其易于处理。

These, then, are the topics for this book: the design, analysis, documentation, and implementation of architectures. We will also examine the influences, principally in the form of business goals and quality attributes, which inform these activities.

这些就是本书的主题：架构的设计、分析、文档和实现。 我们还将主要以业务目标和质量属性的形式检查影响这些活动的影响。

In this chapter we will focus on architecture strictly from a software engineering point of view. That is, we will explore the value that a software architecture brings to a development project. (Later chapters will take a business and organizational perspective.)

在本章中，我们将从软件工程的角度严格关注架构。 也就是说，我们将探索软件架构为开发项目带来的价值。（以后的章节将采用业务和组织的角度。）

_Adapt or perish, now as ever, is nature’s inexorable imperative._   
_适应或灭亡，现在和以往一样，是大自然的必然要求。_   
—H.G. Wells

Change happens.
变化发生了。

Study after study shows that most of the cost of the typical software system occurs after it has been initially released. If change is the only constant in the universe, then software change is not only constant but ubiquitous. Changes happen to add new features, to change or even retire old ones. Changes happen to fix defects, tighten security, or improve performance. Changes happen to enhance the user’s experience. Changes happen to embrace new technology, new platforms, new protocols, new standards. Changes happen to make systems work together, even if they were never designed to do so.

一项又一项的研究表明，典型软件系统的大部分成本是在最初发布之后发生的。 如果变化是宇宙中唯一的常数，那么软件变更不仅是常数，而且无处不在。 变更发生在：添加新功能、更改甚至淘汰旧功能。变更发生在：修复缺陷、加强安全性或提高性能。变更发生在：增强用户的体验。 变更发生在：拥抱新技术、新平台、新协议、新标准。变更发生在：使系统协同工作，即使它们从未被设计成能够协同工作。

Modifiability is about change, and our interest in it centers on the cost and risk of making changes. To plan for modifiability, an architect has to consider four questions:

可修改性与变更有关，而我们对变更的兴趣集中在变更的成本和风险上。 为了计划可修改性，架构师必须考虑四个问题：

* _What can change?_ A change can occur to any aspect of a system: the functions that the system computes, the platform (the hardware, operating system, middleware), the environment in which the system operates (the systems with which it must interoperate, the protocols it uses to communicate with the rest of the world), the qualities the system exhibits (its performance, its reliability, and even its future modifications), and its capacity (number of users supported, number of simultaneous operations).
   _有什么可以改变的？_ 系统的任何方面都可能发生变化：系统计算的功能，平台（硬件，操作系统，中间件），系统运行的环境（必须与之进行互操作的系统，所使用的协议） 与世界各地进行通信），系统所表现出的质量（其性能，可靠性，甚至将来的修改）以及容量（所支持的用户数量，同时运行的数量）。
* _What is the likelihood of the change?_ One cannot plan a system for all potential changes—the system would never be done, or if it was done it would be far too expensive and would likely suffer quality attribute problems in other dimensions. Although anything might change, the architect has to make the tough decisions about which changes are likely, and hence which changes are to be supported, and which are not.
   _更改的可能性是多少？_ 一个人不能为所有潜在的变化计划一个系统-该系统将永远无法完成，或者如果完成了，那将太昂贵了，并且可能会遇到其他方面的质量属性问题。 尽管可能会发生任何变化，但架构师必须做出艰难的决定，即可能发生哪些更改，因此要支持哪些更改，哪些不支持。
* _When is the change made and who makes it?_ Most commonly in the past, a change was made to source code. That is, a developer had to make the change, which was tested and then deployed in a new release. Now, however, the question of when a change is made is intertwined with the question of who makes it. An end user changing the screen saver is clearly making a change to one of the aspects of the system. Equally clear, it is not in the same category as changing the system so that it can be used over the web rather than on a single machine. Changes can be made to the implementation (by modifying the source code), during compile (using compile-time switches), during build (by choice of libraries), during configuration setup (by a range of techniques, including parameter setting), or during execution (by parameter settings, plugins, etc.). A change can also be made by a developer, an end user, or a system administrator.
   _何时进行更改，谁进行更改？_ 过去最常见的情况是对源代码进行了更改。 也就是说，开发人员必须进行更改，然后进行测试，然后将其部署到新版本中。 但是，现在，何时进行更改的问题与谁进行更改的问题交织在一起。 最终用户更改屏幕保护程序显然是在更改系统的各个方面。 同样清楚的是，它与更改系统不在同一类别，因此可以在Web上而不是在单台计算机上使用。 可以在实现过程中（通过修改源代码），在编译过程中（使用编译时开关），在构建过程中（通过选择库），在配置设置过程中（通过一系列技术，包括参数设置）进行更改。 在执行期间（通过参数设置，插件等）。 开发人员，最终用户或系统管理员也可以进行更改。
* _What is the cost of the change?_ Making a system more modifiable involves two types of cost:
   _更改的费用是多少？_ 使系统更具可修改性涉及两种成本：
   * The cost of introducing the mechanism(s) to make the system more modifiable
      引入机制以使系统更易于修改的成本
   * The cost of making the modification using the mechanism(s)
      使用机制进行修改的费用

For example, the simplest mechanism for making a change is to wait for a change request to come in, then change the source code to accommodate the request. The cost of introducing the mechanism is zero; the cost of exercising it is the cost of changing the source code and revalidating the system. At the other end of the spectrum is an application generator, such as a user interface builder. The builder takes as input a description of the designer user interface produced through direct manipulation techniques and produces (usually) source code. The cost of introducing the mechanism is the cost of constructing the UI builder, which can be substantial. The cost of using the mechanism is the cost of producing the input to feed the builder (cost can be substantial or negligible), the cost of running the builder (approximately zero), and then the cost of whatever testing is performed on the result (usually much less than usual).

例如，进行更改的最简单机制是等待更改请求进入，然后更改源代码以适应该请求。 引入该机制的成本为零； 实施它的成本就是更改源代码并重新验证系统的成本。 另一极端是应用程序生成器，例如用户界面生成器。 构建器将通过直接操纵技术生成的设计器用户界面的描述作为输入，并生成（通常）源代码。 引入该机制的成本是构建UI构建器的成本，这可能是巨大的。 使用该机制的成本是产生输入以供生成器使用的成本（成本可以是实质性的或可忽略的），运行生成器的成本（大约为零），然后是对结果执行任何测试的成本（ 通常比平常少得多）。

For N similar modifications, a simplified justification for a change mechanism is that

对于N个类似的修改，更改机制的简化理由是：

```
N × Cost of making the change without the mechanism < Cost of installing the mechanism + (N × Cost of making the change using the mechanism).

N × 在没有机制的情况下进行更改的成本 < 安装机制的成本 + （N × 使用该机制进行更改的成本）。
```

N is the anticipated number of modifications that will use the modifiability mechanism, but N is a prediction. If fewer changes than expected come in, then an expensive modification mechanism may not be warranted. In addition, the cost of creating the modifiability mechanism could be applied elsewhere—in adding functionality, in improving the performance, or even in nonsoftware investments such as buying tech stocks. Also, the equation does not take time into account. It might be cheaper in the long run to build a sophisticated change-handling mechanism, but you might not be able to wait for that.

N是将使用可修改性机制的预期修改数量，但是N是一个预测。 如果更改少于预期，则可能不需要昂贵的修改机制。 此外，创建可修改性机制的成本可以应用到其他地方，例如增加功能，提高性能，甚至用于非软件投资（如购买技术股票）。 同样，该方程式不考虑时间。 从长远来看，建立复杂的变更处理机制可能会更便宜，但是您可能无法等待。

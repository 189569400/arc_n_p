9 Security 安全

_With Jungwoo Ryoo and Phil Laplante_

_Your personal identity isn’t worth quite as much as
it used to be—at least to thieves willing to swipe it.
According to experts who monitor such markets, the
value of stolen credit card data may range from $3 to
as little as 40 cents. That’s down tenfold from a decade
ago—even though the cost to an individual who has a
credit card stolen can soar into the hundreds of dollars._

Security is a measure of the system’s ability to protect data and information from unauthorized access while still providing access to people and systems that are authorized. An action taken against a computer system with the intention of doing harm is called an attack and can take a number of forms. It may be an unauthorized attempt to access data or services or to modify data, or it may be intended to deny services to legitimate users.

The simplest approach to characterizing security has three characteristics: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA):

1. _Confidentiality_ is the property that data or services are protected from unauthorized access. For example, a hacker cannot access your income tax returns on a government computer.
2. _Integrity_ is the property that data or services are not subject to unauthorized manipulation. For example, your grade has not been changed since your instructor assigned it.
3. _Availability_ is the property that the system will be available for legitimate use. For example, a denial-of-service attack won’t prevent you from ordering book from an online bookstore.

Other characteristics that are used to support CIA are these:

4. _Authentication_ verifies the identities of the parties to a transaction and checks if they are truly who they claim to be. For example, when you get an email purporting to come from a bank, authentication guarantees that it actually comes from the bank.
5. _Nonrepudiation_ guarantees that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message, and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message. For example, you cannot deny ordering something from the Internet, or the merchant cannot disclaim getting your order.
6. _Authorization_ grants a user the privileges to perform a task. For example, an online banking system authorizes a legitimate user to access his account.

We will use these characteristics in our general scenarios for security. Approaches to achieving security can be characterized as those that detect attacks, those that resist attacks, those that react to attacks, and those that recover from successful attacks. The objects that are being protected from attacks are data at rest, data in transit, and computational processes.

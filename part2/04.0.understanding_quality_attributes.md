4 Understanding Quality Attributes 理解质量属性
===

_Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._  
— Viktor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning

As we have seen in the Architecture Influence Cycle (in Chapter 3), many factors determine the qualities that must be provided for in a system’s architecture. These qualities go beyond functionality, which is the basic statement of the system’s capabilities, services, and behavior. Although functionality and other qualities are closely related, as you will see, functionality often takes the front seat in the development scheme. This preference is shortsighted, however. Systems are frequently redesigned not because they are functionally deficient—the replacements are often functionally identical—but because they are difficult to maintain, port, or scale; or they are too slow; or they have been compromised by hackers. In Chapter 2, we said that architecture was the first place in software creation in which quality requirements could be addressed. It is the mapping of a system’s functionality onto software structures that determines the architecture’s support for qualities. In Chapters 5–11 we discuss how various qualities are supported by architectural design decisions. In Chapter 17 we show how to integrate all of the quality attribute decisions into a single design.

正如我们在架构影响周期（第3章）中所看到的那样，许多因素决定了系统架构必须提供的质量。这些品质超越了功能，而功能是系统功能、服务和行为的基本说明。正如您将看到的那样，尽管功能和其他质量密切相关，但是功能通常在开发方案中占据重要位置。但是，这种偏好是短视的。经常对系统进行重新设计不是因为它们的功能不足（替代品通常在功能上相同），而是因为它们难以维护、移植或扩展，或它们太慢；否则它们已被黑客入侵。在第二章中，我们说过架构是软件创建中可以解决质量要求的第一位。系统功能到软件架构的映射决定了架构对质量的支持。在第5-11章中，我们讨论了架构设计决策如何支持各种品质。在第17章中，我们展示了如何将所有质量属性决策集成到单个设计中。

We have been using the term “quality attribute” loosely, but now it is time to define it more carefully. A quality attribute (QA) is a measurable or testable property of a system that is used to indicate how well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders. You can think of a quality attribute as measuring the “goodness” of a product along some dimension of interest to a stakeholder.

我们一直在宽松地使用“质量属性”一词，但是现在该更仔细地定义它了。 质量属性（QA）是系统的可测量或可测试的属性，用于指示系统满足其利益相关者需求的程度。 您可以认为质量属性就是沿着利益相关者感兴趣的某个维度来衡量产品的“优劣”。

In this chapter our focus is on understanding the following:

在本章中，我们的重点是理解以下内容：

* How to express the qualities we want our architecture to provide to the system or systems we are building from it
* 如何表达我们希望我们的架构为我们要从中构建的系统提供的质量
* How to achieve those qualities
* 如何实现这些素质
* How to determine the design decisions we might make with respect to those qualities
* 如何确定我们可能针对这些品质做出的设计决策

This chapter provides the context for the discussion of specific quality attributes in Chapters 5–11.

本章提供了在第5-11章中讨论特定质量属性的上下文。

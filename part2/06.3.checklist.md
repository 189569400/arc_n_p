**Table 6.3** Checklist to Support the Design and Analysis Process for Interoperability 支持互操作性设计和分析过程的清单

Category | Checklist
--|--
Allocation of Responsibilities | Determine which of your system responsibilities will need to interoperate with other systems.<br>Ensure that responsibilities have been allocated to detect a request to interoperate with known or unknown external systems.<br>Ensure that responsibilities have been allocated to carry out the following tasks:<br><li>Accept the request<br><li>Exchange information<br><li>Reject the request<br><li>Notify appropriate entities (people or systems)<br><li>Log the request (for interoperability in an untrusted environment, logging for nonrepudiation is essential)
Coordination Model | Ensure that the coordination mechanisms can meet the critical quality attribute requirements. Considerations for performance include the following:<br><li>Volume of traffic on the network both created by the systems under your control and generated by systems not under your control<br><li>Timeliness of the messages being sent by your systems<br><li>Currency of the messages being sent by your systems<br><li>Jitter of the messages’ arrival times<br><li>Ensure that all of the systems under your control make assumptions about protocols and underlying networks that are consistent with the systems not under your control.
Data Model | Determine the syntax and semantics of the major data abstractions that may be exchanged among interoperating systems.<br>Ensure that these major data abstractions are consistent with data from the interoperating systems. (If your system’s data model is confidential and must not be made public, you may have to apply transformations to and from the data abstractions of systems with which yours interoperates.)
Mapping among Architectural Elements | For interoperability, the critical mapping is that of components to processors. Beyond the necessity of making sure that components that communicate externally are hosted on processors that can reach the network, the primary considerations deal with meeting the security, availability, and performance requirements for the communication. These will be dealt with in their respective chapters.

Resource Management | Ensure that interoperation with another system (accepting a request and/or rejecting a request) can never exhaust critical system resources (e.g., can a flood of such requests cause service to be denied to legitimate users?).<br>Ensure that the resource load imposed by the communication requirements of interoperation is acceptable.<br>Ensure that if interoperation requires that resources be shared among the participating systems, an adequate arbitration policy is in place.
Binding Time | Determine the systems that may interoperate, and when they become known to each other. For each system over which you have control:<br><li>Ensure that it has a policy for dealing with binding to both known and unknown external systems.<br><li>Ensure that it has mechanisms in place to reject unacceptable bindings and to log such requests.<br><li>In the case of late binding, ensure that mechanisms will support the discovery of relevant new services or protocols, or the sending of information using chosen protocols.
Choice of Technology | For any of your chosen technologies, are they “visible” at the interface boundary of a system? If so, what interoperability effects do they have? Do they support, undercut, or have no effect on the interoperability scenarios that apply to your system? Ensure the effects they have are acceptable. Consider technologies that are designed to support interoperability, such as web services. Can they be used to satisfy the interoperability requirements for the systems under your control?

职责分配 | 确定需要与其他系统互操作的系统职责。<br>确保已分配职责以检测与已知或未知外部系统互操作的请求。<br>确保已分配职责以执行以下任务：<br><li>接受请求信息<br><li>拒绝请求<br><li>通知适当的实体（人员或系统）<br><li>记录请求（对于在不受信任的环境中的互操作性，记录不可否认性至关重要）
协调模型 | 确保协调机制满足关键质量属性要求。性能方面的考虑因素包括：<br><li>由您控制的系统创建和由不受您控制的系统生成的网络流量<br><li>由您的系统发送的消息的及时性<br><li>由您的系统发送的消息的通用性<br><li>消息到达的抖动时间<br><li>确保所有在您控制下的系统都假设协议和底层网络与不在您控制下的系统一致。
数据模型 | 确定可以在互操作系统之间交换的主要数据抽象的语法和语义。<br>确保这些主要数据抽象与来自互操作系统的数据一致。 （如果您的系统的数据模型是机密的，并且不得公开，则可能必须对与之进行互操作的系统的数据抽象进行转换或从中进行转换。）
架构元素之间的映射 | 对于互操作性，关键的映射是组件到处理器的映射。 除了必须确保外部通信的组件托管在可以访问网络的处理器上之外，主要的考虑还包括满足通信的安全性，可用性和性能要求。 这些将在其各自的章节中进行处理。
资源管理 | 确保与另一个系统的互操作（接受请求和/或拒绝请求）永远不会耗尽关键的系统资源（例如，大量此类请求是否会导致拒绝合法用户使用服务？）。<br>确保该资源 互操作的通信要求所施加的负担是可以接受的。<br>请确保如果互操作要求参与系统之间共享资源，则适当的仲裁策略已经到位。
绑定时间 | 确定可以互操作的系统，以及何时彼此已知。 对于您可以控制的每个系统：<br> <li>确保其具有处理与已知和未知外部系统的绑定的策略。<br> <li>确保具有适当的机制来拒绝不可接受的绑定 <br> <li>在后期绑定的情况下，请确保机制将支持发现相关的新服务或协议，或使用所选协议发送信息。
技术选择 | 对于您选择的任何技术，它们是否在系统的接口边界“可见”？ 如果是这样，它们有什么互操作性影响？ 它们是否支持，削弱或不影响适用于您系统的互操作性方案？ 确保它们具有的效果是可以接受的。 考虑旨在支持互操作性的技术，例如Web服务。 它们可以用来满足您控制下的系统的互操作性要求吗？

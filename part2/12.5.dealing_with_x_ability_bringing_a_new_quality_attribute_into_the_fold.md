12.5 Dealing with “X-ability”: Bringing a New Quality Attribute into the Fold
===

Suppose, as an architect, you must deal with a quality attribute for which there is no compact body of knowledge, no “portfolio” like Chapters 5–11 provided for those seven QAs? Suppose you find yourself having to deal with a quality attribute like “green computing” or “manageability” or even “Iowability”? What do you do?

## Capture Scenarios for the New Quality Attribute

The first thing to do is interview the stakeholders whose concerns have led to the need for this quality attribute. You can work with them, either individually or as a group, to build a set of attribute characterizations that refine what is meant by the QA. For example, security is often decomposed into concerns such as confi-dentiality, integrity, availability, and others. After that refinement, you can work with the stakeholders to craft a set of specific scenarios that characterize what is meant by that QA.

Once you have a set of specific scenarios, then you can work to generalize the collection. Look at the set of stimuli you’ve collected, the set of responses, the set of response measures, and so on. Use those to construct a general scenario by making each part of the general scenario a generalization of the specific in-stances you collected.

In our experience, the steps described so far tend to consume about half a day.

## Assemble Design Approaches for the New Quality Attribute
After you have a set of guiding scenarios for the QA, you can assemble a set of design approaches for dealing with it. You can do this by
1. Revisiting a body of patterns you’re familiar with and asking yourself how each one affects the QA of interest.
2. Searching for designs that have had to deal with this QA. You can search on the name you’ve given the QA itself, but you can also search for the terms you chose when you refined the QA into subsidiary attribute characteriza-tions (such as “confidentiality” for the QA of security).
3. Finding experts in this area and interviewing them or simply writing and asking them for advice.
4. Using the general scenario to try to catalog a list of design approaches to produce the responses in the response category.
5. Using the general scenario to catalog a list of ways in which a problematic architecture would fail to produce the desired responses, and thinking of design approaches to head off those cases.

## Model the New Quality attribute
If you can build a conceptual model of the quality attribute, this can be helpful in creating a set of design approaches for it. By “model,” we don’t mean anything more than understanding the set of parameters to which the quality attribute is sensitive. For example, a model of modifiability might tell us that modifiability is a function of how many places in a system have to be changed in response to a modification, and the interconnectedness of those places. A model for perfor- mance might tell us that throughput is a function of transactional workload, the dependencies among the transactions, and the number of transactions that can be processed in parallel.

Once you have a model for your QA, then you can work to catalog the ar-chitectural approaches (tactics and patterns) open to you for manipulating each of the relevant parameters in your favor.

## Assemble a Set of Tactics for the New Quality Attribute
There are two sources that can be used to derive tactics for any quality attribute: models and experts.

Figure 12.2 shows a queuing model for performance. Such models are widely used to analyze the latency and throughput of various types of queuing systems, including manufacturing and service environments, as well as computer systems.

Within this model, there are seven parameters that can affect the latency that the model predicts:
* Arrival rate
* Queuing discipline
* Scheduling algorithm
* Service time
* Topology
* Network bandwidth
* Routing algorithm

These are the _only_ parameters that can affect latency within this model. This is what gives the model its power. Furthermore, each of these parameters can be affected by various architectural decisions. This is what makes the model useful for an architect. For example, the routing algorithm can be fixed or it could be a load-balancing algorithm. A scheduling algorithm must be chosen. The topology can be affected by dynamically adding or removing new servers. And so forth.

The process of generating tactics based on a model is this:
* Enumerate the parameters of the model
* For each parameter, enumerate the architectural decisions that can affect this parameter

What results is a list of tactics to, in the example case, control performance and, in the more general case, to control the quality attribute that the model is concerned with. This makes the design problem seem much more tractable. This list of tactics is finite and reasonably small, because the number of parameters of the model is bounded, and for each parameter, the number of architectural deci-
sions to affect the parameter is limited.

Deriving tactics from models is fine as long as the quality attribute in ques-tion has a model. Unfortunately, the number of such models is limited and is a subject of active research. There are no good architectural models for usability or security, for example. In the cases where we had no model to work from, we did four things to catalog the tactics:
1. We interviewed experts in the field, asking them what they do as architects to improve the quality attribute response.
2. We examined systems that were touted as having high usability (or testabil-ity, or whatever tactic we were focusing on).
3. We scoured the relevant design literature looking for common themes in design.
4. We examined documented architectural patterns to look for ways they achieved the quality attribute responses touted for them.

## Construct Design Checklists for the New Quality Attribute
Finally, examine the seven categories of design decisions in Chapter 4 and ask yourself (or your experts) how to specialize your new quality of interest to these categories. In particular, think about reviewing a software architecture and trying to figure out how well it satisfies your new qualities in these seven categories. What questions would you ask the architect of that system to understand how the design attempts to achieve the new quality? These are the basis for the design checklist.

_With Liming Zhu_

_The early bird (A) arrives and catches worm (B), pulling string (C) and shooting off pistol (D). Bullet (E) bursts balloon (F), dropping brick (G) on bulb (H) of atomizer (I) and shooting perfume (J) on sponge (K). As sponge gains in weight, it lowers itself and pulls string (L), raising end of board (M). Cannon ball (N) drops on nose of sleeping gentleman. String tied to cannon ball releases cork (O) of vacuum bottle (P) and ice water falls on sleeper’s face to assist the cannon ball in its good work._

Interoperability is about the degree to which two or more systems can usefully exchange meaningful information via interfaces in a particular context. The definition includes not only having the ability to exchange data (syntactic interoperability) but also having the ability to correctly interpret the data being exchanged (semantic interoperability). A system cannot be interoperable in isolation. Any discussion of a system’s interoperability needs to identify with whom, with what, and under what circumstances—hence, the need to include the context.

互操作性大约是指两个或多个系统可以在特定上下文中通过接口有效交换有意义的信息的程度。 该定义不仅包括具有交换数据的能力（语法互操作性），而且还具有正确解释正在交换的数据的能力（语义互操作性）。 系统不能孤立地互操作。 对系统互操作性的任何讨论都需要确定与谁，什么以及在什么情况下（因此需要包含上下文）。

Interoperability is affected by the systems expected to interoperate. If we already know the interfaces of external systems with which our system will interoperate, then we can design that knowledge into the system. Or we can design our system to interoperate in a more generic fashion, so that the identity and the services that another system provides can be bound later in the life cycle, at build time or runtime.

互操作性受预期可互操作的系统的影响。 如果我们已经知道与系统进行互操作的外部系统的接口，则可以将这些知识设计到系统中。 或者我们可以将系统设计为以更通用的方式进行互操作，以便可以在生命周期的后期，构建时或运行时绑定其他系统提供的标识和服务。

Like all quality attributes, interoperability is not a yes-or-no proposition but has shades of meaning. There are several characterizing frameworks for interoperability, all of which seem to define five levels of interoperability “maturity” (see the “For Further Reading” section at the end of this chapter for a pointer). The lowest level signifies systems that do not share data at all, or do not do so with any success. The highest level signifies systems that work together seamlessly, never make any mistakes interpreting each other’s communications, and share the same underlying semantic model of the world in which they work.

像所有质量属性一样，互操作性不是“是或不是”的命题，而是具有深浅的含义。 有几个互操作性的特征描述框架，它们似乎都定义了五个级别的互操作性“成熟度”（有关指针，请参见本章末尾的“更多阅读”部分）。 最低级别表示完全不共享数据或不成功共享数据的系统。 最高级别表示系统可以无缝协作，在解释彼此的通信时不会犯任何错误，并且共享与工作环境相同的基本语义模型。

> 在这一点上，我们需要澄清两个关键概念，这是讨论的核心，并强调我们对每个概念都具有广泛的看法。
>
> The first is what it means to “exchange information.” This can mean something as simple as program A calling program B with some parameters. However, two systems (or parts of a system) can exchange information even if they never communicate directly with each other. Did you ever have a conversation like the following in junior high school? “Charlene said that Kim told her that Trevor heard that Heather wants to come to your party.” Of course, junior high school protocol would preclude the possibility of responding directly to Heather. Instead, your response (if you like Heather) might be, “Cool,” which would make its way back through Charlene, Kim, and Trevor. You and Heather exchanged information, but never talked to each other. (We hope you got to talk to each other at the party.)

> 第一个是“交换信息”的含义。这可能意味着像程序A这样简单的事情，它调用带有某些参数的程序B。 但是，即使两个系统（或系统的一部分）从不相互直接通信，也可以交换信息。 在初中时，您是否曾经有过如下对话？ “夏琳说金告诉她，特雷弗听说希瑟想参加你的聚会。”当然，初中的协议将排除直接回应希瑟的可能性。 相反，您的回答（如果您喜欢Heather）可能是“酷”，它将通过Charlene，Kim和Trevor返回。 您和希瑟（Heather）交换了信息，但从未互相交谈。 （我们希望您在聚会上能互相交谈。）
>
> Entities can exchange information in even less direct ways. If I have an idea of a program’s behavior, and I design my program to work assuming that behavior, the two programs have also exchanged information—just not at runtime.

> 实体可以以更少直接的方式交换信息。 如果我对某个程序的行为有一个了解，并且我将程序设计为在假定该行为的情况下运行，那么这两个程序也已经交换了信息，而不仅仅是在运行时。

> One of the more infamous software disasters in history occurred when an antimissile system failed to intercept an incoming ballistic rocket in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, resulting in 28 fatalities. One of the missile’s software components “expected” to be shut down and restarted periodically, so it could recalibrate its orientation framework from a known initial point. The software had been running for some 100 hours when the missile was launched, and calculation errors had accumulated to the point where the software component’s idea of its orientation had wandered hopelessly away from truth.

> 历史上最臭名昭著的软件灾难之一是，1991年反导系统未能拦截“沙漠风暴”行动中的一枚弹道导弹，造成28人死亡。 导弹的软件组件之一“有望”被关闭并定期重启，因此它可以从已知的起点重新校准其定向框架。 导弹发射时，该软件已经运行了大约100个小时，并且计算错误已累积到一定程度，以至于该软件组件的定向概念已无可救药地偏离了事实。
>
> Systems (or components within systems) often have or embody expectations about the behaviors of its “information exchange” partners. The assumption of everything interacting with the errant component in the preceding example was that its accuracy did not degrade over time. The result was a system of parts that did not work together correctly to solve the problem they were supposed to.
>
> 系统（或系统中的组件）通常对其“信息交换”合作伙伴的行为抱有或体现期望。 在前面的示例中，所有与错误组件交互的假设都是其准确性不会随时间而降低。 结果是零件系统无法正确协作以解决它们应解决的问题。
>
> The second concept we need to stress is what we mean by “interface.” Once again, we mean something beyond the simple case—a syntactic description of a component’s programs and the type and number of their parameters, most commonly realized as an API. That’s necessary for interoperability—heck, it’s necessary if you want your software to compile successfully—but it’s not sufficient. To illustrate this concept, we’ll use another “conversation” analogy. Has your partner or spouse ever come home, slammed the door, and when you ask what’s wrong, replied “Nothing!”? If so, then you should be able to appreciate the keen difference between syntax and semantics and the role of expectations in understanding how an entity behaves. Because we want interoperable systems and components, and not simply ones that compile together nicely, we require a higher bar for interfaces than just a statement of syntax. By “interface,” we mean the set of assumptions that you can safely make about an entity. For example, it’s a safe assumption that whatever’s wrong with your spouse/partner, it’s not “Nothing,” and you know that because that “interface” extends way beyond just the words they say. And it’s also a safe assumption that nothing about our missile component’s accuracy degradation over time was in its API, and yet that was a critical part of its interface.
>
> 我们需要强调的第二个概念是“接口”的含义。我们再一次指的是简单情况之外的东西-组件程序的语法描述及其参数的类型和数量，通常以API的形式实现。这对于实现互操作性是必要的-哎呀，如果您希望软件成功编译是必要的-但还不够。为了说明这个概念，我们将使用另一个“对话”类比。您的伴侣或配偶是否曾经回家，砸过门，当您问出什么问题时，回答“没事！”？如果是这样，那么您应该能够理解语法和语义之间的敏锐差异以及期望在理解实体行为方面的作用。因为我们需要可互操作的系统和组件，而不是简单地很好地编译在一起的系统和组件，所以我们要求接口的标准更高，而不仅仅是语法声明。所谓“接口”，是指您可以安全地对实体进行的一系列假设。例如，可以安全地假设您的配偶/伴侣有什么毛病，不是“什么都没有”，您知道那是因为“接口”不仅限于他们所说的话。而且这也是一个安全的假设，即我们的导弹组件的API随时间的推移不会降低精度，但这是其界面的关键部分。

Here are some of the reasons you might want systems to interoperate:

您可能希望系统进行互操作的一些原因如下：

* Your system provides a service to be used by a collection of unknown systems. These systems need to interoperate with your system even though you may know nothing about them. An example is a service such as Google Maps.
   您的系统提供了供未知系统集合使用的服务。 这些系统需要与您的系统进行互操作，即使您可能对它们一无所知。 一个示例是诸如Google Maps之类的服务。
* You are constructing capabilities from existing systems. For example, one of the existing systems is responsible for sensing its environment, another one is responsible for processing the raw data, a third is responsible for interpreting the data, and a final one is responsible for producing and distributing a representation of what was sensed. An example is a traffic sensing system where the input comes from individual vehicles, the raw data is processed into common units of measurement, is interpreted and fused, and traffic congestion information is broadcast.
   您正在从现有系统中构建功能。 例如，一个现有系统负责感测其环境，另一个系统负责处理原始数据，第三个系统负责解释数据，最后一个系统负责生成和分发所感测的内容的表示形式。 。 一个示例是交通传感系统，其中输入来自各个车辆，原始数据被处理为通用的度量单位，被解释和融合，并广播交通拥堵信息。

These examples highlight two important aspects of interoperability:

这些示例突出了互操作性的两个重要方面：

1. _Discovery_. The consumer of a service must discover (possibly at runtime, possibly prior to runtime) the location, identity, and the interface of the service.  
   _发现_。 服务的使用者必须发现（可能在运行时，可能在运行时之前）服务的位置，身份和接口。
2. _Handling of the response_. There are three distinct possibilities:  
   _处理响应_。 有三种不同的可能性：
   * The service reports back to the requester with the response.
      服务将响应报告给请求者。
   * The service sends its response on to another system.
      服务将其响应发送到另一个系统。
   * The service broadcasts its response to any interested parties.
      该服务将其响应广播给任何感兴趣的各方。

These elements, discovery and disposition of response, along with management of interfaces, govern our discussion of scenarios and tactics for interoperability.

这些要素（响应的发现和处置以及接口的管理）控制着我们对场景和互操作性策略的讨论。

> If you have a group of systems that are interoperating to achieve a joint purpose, you have what is called a system of systems (SoS). An SoS is an arrangement of systems that results when independent and useful systems are integrated into a larger system that delivers unique capabilities. Table 6.1 shows a categorization of SoSs.

> In directed and acknowledged SoSs, there is a deliberate attempt to create an SoS. The key difference is that in the former, there is SoS-level management that exercises control over the constituent systems, while in the latter, the constituent systems retain a high degree of autonomy in their own evolution. Collaborative and virtual systems of systems are more ad hoc, absent an overarching authority or source of funding and, in the case of a virtual SoS, even absent the knowledge about the scope and membership of the SoS.
>
> 在定向和公认的SoS中，有意创建SoS。 关键的区别在于，在前者中，存在SoS级管理来对组成系统进行控制，而在后者中，组成系统在其自身的演化中保留了高度的自治性。 系统的协作和虚拟系统更特别，缺少总体权限或资金来源，对于虚拟SoS，甚至缺少关于SoS范围和成员资格的知识。
> 
> The collaborative case is quite common. Consider the Google Maps example from the introduction. Google is the manager and funding authority for the map service. Each use of the maps in an application (an SoS) has its own management and funding authority, and there is no overall management of all of the applications that use Google Maps. The various organizations involved in the applications collaborate (either explicitly or implicitly) to enable the applications to work correctly.
> 
> 合作案例非常普遍。 考虑一下引言中的Google Maps示例。 Google是地图服务的管理者和资助机构。 应用程序（SoS）中对地图的每次使用都有其自己的管理和资金授权，并且对使用Google Maps的所有应用程序没有全面的管理。 应用程序中涉及的各种组织（显式或隐式）进行协作以使应用程序正常工作。
>
> A virtual SoS involves large systems and is much more ad hoc. For example, there are over 3,000 electric companies in the U.S. electric grid, each state has a public utility commission that oversees the utility companies operating in its state, and the federal Department of Energy provides some level of policy guidance. Many of the systems within the electric grid must interoperate, but there is no management authority for the overall system.

> 虚拟SoS涉及大型系统，并且是临时性的。 例如，美国电网中有3,000多家电力公司，每个州都有一个公用事业委员会，负责监督在该州运营的公用事业公司，而联邦能源部则提供一定程度的政策指导。 电网中的许多系统必须可以互操作，但是整个系统没有管理权限。

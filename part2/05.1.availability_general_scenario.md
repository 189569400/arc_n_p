5.1 Availability General Scenario
===

From these considerations we can now describe the individual portions of an availability general scenario. These are summarized in Table 5.3:

* _Source of stimulus_. We differentiate between internal and external origins of faults or failure because the desired system response may be different.
* _Stimulus_. A fault of one of the following classes occurs:
  * _Omission_. A component fails to respond to an input.
  * _Crash_. The component repeatedly suffers omission faults.
  * _Timing_. A component responds but the response is early or late.
  * _Response_. A component responds with an incorrect value.
* _Artifact_. This specifies the resource that is required to be highly available, such as a processor, communication channel, process, or storage.
* _Environment_. The state of the system when the fault or failure occurs may also affect the desired system response. For example, if the system has already seen some faults and is operating in other than normal mode, it may be desirable to shut it down totally. However, if this is the first fault observed, some degradation of response time or function may be preferred.
* _Response_. There are a number of possible reactions to a system fault. First, the fault must be detected and isolated (correlated) before any other response is possible. (One exception to this is when the fault is prevented before it occurs.) After the fault is detected, the system must recover from it. Actions associated with these possibilities include logging the failure, notifying selected users or other systems, taking actions to limit the damage caused by the fault, switching to a degraded mode with either less capacity or less function, shutting down external systems, or becoming unavailable during repair.
* _Response measure_. The response measure can specify an availability percentage, or it can specify a time to detect the fault, time to repair the fault, times or time intervals during which the system must be available, or the duration for which the system must be available.

Figure 5.3 shows a concrete scenario generated from the general scenario: The heartbeat monitor determines that the server is nonresponsive during normal operations. The system informs the operator and continues to operate with no downtime.

**Table 5.3** Availability General Scenario
Portion of Scenario | Possible Values
--|--
Source | Internal/external: people, hardware, software, physical infrastructure, physical environment
Stimulus | Fault: omission, crash, incorrect timing, incorrect response
Artifact | Processors, communication channels, persistent storage, processes
Environment | Normal operation, startup, shutdown, repair mode, degraded operation, overloaded operation
Response | Prevent the fault from becoming a failure<br>Detect the fault:<br><ul><li>Log the fault<li>Notify appropriate entities (people or systems)</ul>Recover from the fault:<ul><li>Disable source of events causing the fault<li>Be temporarily unavailable while repair is being effected<li>Fix or mask the fault/failure or contain the damage it causes<li>Operate in a degraded mode while repair is being effected</ul>
Response Measure | Time or time interval when the system must be available <br>Availability percentage (e.g., 99.999%) <br>Time to detect the fault  <br>Time to repair the fault <br>Time or time interval in which system can be in degraded mode Proportion (e.g., 99%) or rate (e.g., up to 100 per second) of a certain class of faults that the system prevents, or handles without failing

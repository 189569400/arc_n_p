14 Quality Attribute Modeling and Analysis 质量属性模型和分析
===

_Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it . . . Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it._  
_不要仅仅因为听到了就相信任何事情。不要只相信老师和长辈的权威。不要相信传统，因为它们已经传了好几代了。但是，经过观察和分析，当你发现任何事情都符合理性，有利于一个人和所有人的利益时，那么就接受它，并履行它。_   
—Prince Gautama Siddhartha 释迦牟尼

In Chapter 2 we listed thirteen reasons why architecture is important, worth studying, and worth practicing. Reason 6 is that the analysis of an architecture enables early prediction of a system’s qualities. This is an extraordinarily powerful reason! Without it, we would be reduced to building systems by choosing various structures, implementing the system, measuring the system for its quality attribute responses, and all along the way hoping for the best. Architecture lets us do better than that, much better. We can analyze an architecture to see how the system or systems we build from it will perform with respect to their quality attribute goals, even before a single line of code has been written. This chapter will explore how.

在第二章中，我们列出了架构之所以重要、值得研究和实践的十三个原因。原因6是对架构的分析能够早期预测系统的质量。这是一个非常有力的理由！没有它，我们就只能通过尝试选择各种架构、实施系统、测量系统的质量属性响应来构建系统，并一直希望达到最好。架构让我们做得更好，更好。我们可以分析一个架构，以查看我们从中构建的一个或多个系统在质量属性目标方面的性能，甚至在编写一行代码之前。本章将探讨如何进行分析。

The methods available depend, to a large extent, on the quality attribute to be analyzed. Some quality attributes, especially performance and availability, have well-understood and strongly validated analytic modeling techniques. Other quality attributes, for example security, can be analyzed through checklists. Still others can be analyzed through back-of-the-envelope calculations and thought experiments.

可用的方法在很大程度上取决于待分析的质量属性。一些质量属性，尤其是性能和可用性，已经被很好地理解并得到了有力的验证。其他质量属性，例如安全性，可以通过检查表进行分析。还有一些可以通过粗略计算和思维实验进行分析。

Our topics in this chapter range from the specific, such as creating models and analyzing checklists, to the general, such as how to generate and carry out the thought experiments to perform early (and necessarily crude) analysis. Models and checklists are focused on particular quality attributes but can aid in the analysis of any system with respect to those attributes. Thought experiments, on the other hand, can consider multiple quality attributes simultaneously but are only applicable to the specific system under consideration.

本章中我们的主题从具体的，如创建模型和分析检查表，到一般的，如如何生成和执行思维实验，以执行早期（必然是粗略的）分析。模型和检查表侧重于特定的质量属性，但可以帮助分析与这些属性相关的任何系统。另一方面，思想实验可以同时考虑多个质量属性，但仅适用于所考虑的特定系统。

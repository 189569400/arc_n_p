8.4 Summary
===

Performance is about the management of system resources in the face of partic-ular types of demand to achieve acceptable timing behavior. Performance can be measured in terms of throughput and latency for both interactive and embedded real-time systems, although throughput is usually more important in interactive systems, and latency is more important in embedded systems.

Performance can be improved by reducing demand or by managing re-sources more appropriately. Reducing demand will have the side effect of re-ducing fidelity or refusing to service some requests. Managing resources more appropriately can be done through scheduling, replication, or just increasing the resources available.

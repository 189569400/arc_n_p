10.5 For Further Reading

An excellent general introduction to software testing is [Beizer 90]. For a more modern take on testing, and from the software developer’s perspective rather than the tester’s, Freeman and Pryce cover test-driven development in the object-ori-ented realm [Freeman 09].

Bertolino and Strigini [Bertolino 96] are the developers of the model of test-ing shown in Figure 10.1.

Yin and Bieman [Yin 94] have written about executable assertions. Hartman [Hartman 10] describes a technique for using executable assertions as a means for detecting race conditions.

Bruntink and van Deursen [Bruntink 06] write about the impact of structure on testing.

Jeff Voas’s foundational work on testability and the relationship between testability and reliability is worthwhile. There are several papers to choose from, but [Voas 95] is a good start that will point you to others.

9.1 Security General Scenario
===

One technique that is used in the security domain is threat modeling. An “attack tree,” similar to a fault tree discussed in Chapter 5, is used by security engineers to determine possible threats. The root is a successful attack and the nodes are possible direct causes of that successful attack. Children nodes decompose the direct causes, and so forth. An attack is an attempt to break CIA, and the leaves of attack trees would be the stimulus in the scenario. The response to the attack is to preserve CIA or deter attackers through monitoring of their activities. From these considerations we can now describe the individual portions of a security general scenario. These are ummarized in Table 9.1, and an example security scenario is given in Figure 9.1.

* _Source of stimulus_. The source of the attack may be either a human or another system. It may have been previously identified (either correctly or incorrectly) or may be currently unknown. A human attacker may be from outside the organization or from inside the organization.
* _Stimulus_. The stimulus is an attack. We characterize this as an unauthorized attempt to display data, change or delete data, access system services, change the system’s behavior, or reduce availability.
* _Artifact_. The target of the attack can be either the services of the system, the data within it, or the data produced or consumed by the system. Some attacks are made on particular components of the system known to be vulnerable.
* _Environment_. The attack can come when the system is either online or offline, either connected to or disconnected from a network, either behind a firewall or open to a network, fully operational, partially operational, or not operational.
* _Response_. The system should ensure that transactions are carried out in a fashion such that data or services are protected from unauthorized access; data or services are not being manipulated without authorization; parties to a transaction are identified with assurance; the parties to the transaction cannot repudiate their involvements; and the data, resources, and system services will be available for legitimate use.  
The system should also track activities within it by recording access or modification; attempts to access data, resources, or services; and noti-fying appropriate entities (people or systems) when an apparent attack is occurring.
* _Response measure_. Measures of a system’s response include how much of a system is compromised when a particular component or data value is compromised, how much time passed before an attack was detected, how many attacks were resisted, how long it took to recover from a successful attack, and how much data was vulnerable to a particular attack. 
 
Table 9.1 enumerates the elements of the general scenario, which charac-terize security, and Figure 9.1 shows a sample concrete scenario: A disgruntled employee from a remote location attempts to modify the pay rate table during normal operations. The system maintains an audit trail, and the correct data is restored within a day.

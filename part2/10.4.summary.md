10.4 Summary

Ensuring that a system is easily testable has payoffs both in terms of the cost of testing and the reliability of the system. A vehicle often used to execute the tests is the test harness. Test harnesses are software systems that encapsulate test re-sources such as test cases and test infrastructure so that it is easy to reapply tests across iterations and it is easy to apply the test infrastructure to new increments of the system. Another vehicle is the creation of test cases prior to the develop-ment of a component, so that developers know which tests their component must pass.

Controlling and observing the system state is a major class of testability tactics. Providing the ability to do fault injection, to record system state at key portions of the system, to isolate the system from its environment, and to abstract various resources are all different tactics to support the control and observation of a system and its components.

Complex systems are difficult to test because of the large state space in which their computations take place, and because of the larger number of inter-connections among the elements of the system. Consequently, keeping the sys-tem simple is another class of tactics that supports testability.

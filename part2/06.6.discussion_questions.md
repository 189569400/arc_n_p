1. Find a web service mashup. Write several concrete interoperability scenarios for this system.
2. What is the relationship between interoperability and the other quality attributes highlighted in this book? For example, if two systems fail to exchange information properly, could a security flaw result? What other quality attributes seem strongly related (at least potentially) to interoperability?
3. Is a service-oriented system a system of systems? If so, describe a service-oriented system that is directed, one that is acknowledged, one that is collaborative, and one that is virtual.

5. Why has the importance of orchestration grown in recent years?
6. If you are a technology producer, what are the advantages and disadvantages of adhering to interoperability standards? Why would a producer not adhere to a standard?

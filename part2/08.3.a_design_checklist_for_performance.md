TABLE 8.2 Checklist to Support the Design and Analysis Process for Performance

Category | Checklist
---|---
Allocation of Responsibilities | Determine the system’s responsibilities that will involve heavy loading, have time-critical response requirements, are heavily used, or impact portions of the system where heavy loads or time-critical events occur.  <br>For those responsibilities, identify the processing requirements of each responsibility, and determine whether they may cause bottlenecks. <br>Also, identify additional responsibilities to recognize and process requests appropriately, including <li> Responsibilities that result from a thread of control crossing process or processor boundaries <li> Responsibilities to manage the threads of control—allocation and deallocation of threads, maintaining thread pools, and so forth <li> Responsibilities for scheduling shared resources or managing performance-related artifacts such as queues, buffers, and caches <br>For the responsibilities and resources you identified, ensure that the required performance response can be met (perhaps by building a performance model to help in the evaluation). 
Coordination Model | Determine the elements of the system that must coordinate with each other—directly or indirectly—and choose communication and coordination mechanisms that do the following: <br> <li> Support any introduced concurrency (for example, is it thread safe?), event prioritization, or scheduling strategy <li> Ensure that the required performance response can be delivered <li> Can capture periodic, stochastic, or sporadic event arrivals, as needed <li> Have the appropriate properties of the communication mechanisms; for example, stateful, stateless, synchronous, asynchronous, guaranteed delivery, throughput, or latency 
Data Model | Determine those portions of the data model that will be heavily loaded, have time-critical response requirements, are heavily used, or impact portions of the system where heavy loads or time-critical events occur. <br>For those data abstractions, determine the following: <li> Whether maintaining multiple copies of key data would benefit performance <li> Whether partitioning data would benefit performance <li> Whether reducing the processing requirements for the creation, initialization, persistence, manipulation, translation, or destruction of the enumerated data abstractions is possible <li> Whether adding resources to reduce bottlenecks for the creation, initialization, persistence, manipulation, translation, or destruction of the enumerated data abstractions is feasible 
Mapping among Architectural Elements | Where heavy network loading will occur, determine whether co-locating some components will reduce loading and improve overall efficiency. <br>Ensure that components with heavy computation requirements are assigned to processors with the most processing capacity. <br>Determine where introducing concurrency (that is, allocating a piece of functionality to two or more copies of a component running simultaneously) is feasible and has a significant positive effect on performance. <br>Determine whether the choice of threads of control and their associated responsibilities introduces bottlenecks. 
Resource Management | Determine which resources in your system are critical for performance. For these resources, ensure that they will be monitored and managed under normal and overloaded system operation. For example: <br> <li> System elements that need to be aware of, and manage, time and other performance-critical resources <li> Process/thread models <li> Prioritization of resources and access to resources <li> Scheduling and locking strategies <li> Deploying additional resources on demand to meet increased loads
Binding Time | For each element that will be bound after compile time, determine the following: <br> <li> Time necessary to complete the binding <li> Additional overhead introduced by using the late binding mechanism <br>Ensure that these values do not pose unacceptable performance penalties on the system. 
Choice of Technology | Will your choice of technology let you set and meet hard, real-time deadlines? Do you know its characteristics under load and its limits? <br>Does your choice of technology give you the ability to set the following: <br> <li> Scheduling policy <li> Priorities <li> Policies for reducing demand <li> Allocation of portions of the technology to processors <li> Other performance-related parameters <br>Does your choice of technology introduce excessive overhead for heavily used operations?

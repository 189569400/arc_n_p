10 Testability 可测试性
===

_Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding_  
—Burt Rutan

Industry estimates indicate that between 30 and 50 percent (or in some cases, even more) of the cost of developing well-engineered systems is taken up by testing. If the software architect can reduce this cost, the payoff is large.

Software testability refers to the ease with which software can be made to demonstrate its faults through (typically execution-based) testing. Specifically, testability refers to the probability, assuming that the software has at least one fault, that it will fail on its next test execution. Intuitively, a system is testable if it “gives up” its faults easily. If a fault is present in a system, then we want it to fail during testing as quickly as possible. Of course, calculating this probability is not easy and, as you will see when we discuss response measures for testability, other measures will be used.

Figure 10.1 shows a model of testing in which a program processes input and produces output. An oracle is an agent (human or mechanical) that decides whether the output is correct or not by comparing the output to the program’s specification. Output is not just the functionally produced value, but it also can include derived measures of quality attributes such as how long it took to produce the output. Figure 10.1 also shows that the program’s internal state can also be shown to the oracle, and an oracle can decide whether that is correct or not—that is, it can detect whether the program has entered an erroneous state and render a judgment as to the correctness of the program.

Setting and examining a program’s internal state is an aspect of testing that will figure prominently in our tactics for testability.

For a system to be properly testable, it must be possible to control each component’s inputs (and possibly manipulate its internal state) and then to observe its outputs (and possibly its internal state, either after or on the way to computing the outputs). Frequently this control and observation is done through the use of a test harness, which is specialized software (or in some cases, hardware) designed to exercise the software under test. Test harnesses come in various forms, such as a record-and-playback capability for data sent across various interfaces, or a simulator for an external environment in which a piece of embedded software is tested, or even during production (see sidebar). The test harness can provide assistance in executing the test procedures and recording the output. A test harness can be a substantial piece of software in its own right, with its own architecture, stakeholders, and quality attribute requirements.

Testing is carried out by various developers, users, or quality assurance personnel. Portions of the system or the entire system may be tested. The response measures for testability deal with how effective the tests are in discovering faults and how long it takes to perform the tests to some desired level of coverage. Test cases can be written by the developers, the testing group, or the customer. The test cases can be a portion of acceptance testing or can drive the development as they do in certain types of Agile methodologies.

> Netflix’s Simian Army

Netflix distributes movies and television shows both via DVD and via streaming video. Their streaming video service has been extremely successful. In May 2011 Netflix streaming video accounted for 24 percent of the Internet traffic in North America. Naturally, high availability is important to Netflix.

Netflix hosts their computer services in the Amazon EC2 cloud, and they utilize what they call a “Simian Army” as a portion of their testing process. They began with a Chaos Monkey, which randomly kills processes in the running system. This allows the monitoring of the effect of failed processes and gives the ability to ensure that the system does not fail or suffer serious degradation as a result of a process failure.

Recently, the Chaos Monkey got some friends to assist in the testing. Currently, the Netflix Simian Army includes these:

* The Latency Monkey induces artificial delays in the client-server communication layer to simulate service degradation and measures if upstream services respond appropriately.
* The Conformity Monkey finds instances that don’t adhere to best practices and shuts them down. For example, if an instance does not belong to an auto-scaling group, it will not appropriately scale when demand goes up.
* The Doctor Monkey taps into health checks that run on each instance as well as monitors other external signs of health (e.g., CPU load) to detect unhealthy instances.
* The Janitor Monkey ensures that the Netflix cloud environment is running free of clutter and waste. It searches for unused resources and disposes of them.
* The Security Monkey is an extension of Conformity Monkey. It finds security violations or vulnerabilities, such as improperly configured security groups, and terminates the offending instances. It also ensures that all the SSL and digital rights management (DRM) certificates are valid and are not coming up for renewal.
* The 10-18 Monkey (localization-internationalization) detects configuration and runtime problems in instances serving customers in multiple geographic regions, using different languages and character sets. The name 10-18 comes from L10n-i18n, a sort of shorthand for the words localization and internationalization.

Some of the members of the Simian Army use fault injection to place faults into the running system in a controlled and monitored fashion. Other members monitor various specialized aspects of the system and its environment. Both of these techniques have broader applicability than just Netflix.

Not all faults are equal in terms of severity. More emphasis should be placed on finding the most severe faults than on finding other faults. The Simian Army reflects a determination by Netflix that the faults they look for are the most serious in terms of their impact.

This strategy illustrates that some systems are too complex and adaptive to be tested fully, because some of their behaviors are emergent. An aspect of testing in that arena is logging of operational data produced by the system, so that when failures occur, the logged data can be analyzed in the lab to try to reproduce the faults. Architecturally this can require mechanisms to access and log certain system state. The Simian Army is one way to discover and log behavior in systems of this ilk.

Testing of code is a special case of validation, which is making sure that an engineered artifact meets the needs of its stakeholders or is suitable for use. In Chapter 21 we will discuss architectural design reviews. This is another kind of validation, where the artifact being tested is the architecture. In this chapter we are concerned only with the testability of a running system and of its source code.

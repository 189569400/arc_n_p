Modifiability deals with change and the cost in time or money of making a
change, including the extent to which this modification affects other functions or
quality attributes.
Changes can be made by developers, installers, or end users, and these
changes need to be prepared for. There is a cost of preparing for change as well
as a cost of making a change. The modifiability tactics are designed to prepare for
subsequent changes.
Tactics to reduce the cost of making a change include making modules
smaller, increasing cohesion, and reducing coupling. Deferring binding will also
reduce the cost of making a change.
Reducing coupling is a standard category of tactics that includes encapsulating,
using an intermediary, restricting dependencies, co-locating related responsibilities,
refactoring, and abstracting common services.
Increasing cohesion is another standard tactic that involves separating responsibilities
that do not serve the same purpose.
Defer binding is a category of tactics that affect build time, load time, initialization
time, or runtime.

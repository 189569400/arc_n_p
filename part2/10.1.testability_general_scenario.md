10.1 Testability General Scenario
===

We can now describe the general scenario for testability.
* _Source of stimulus_. The testing is performed by unit testers, integration testers, or system testers (on the developing organization side), or acceptance testers and end users (on the customer side). The source could be human or an automated tester.
* _Stimulus_. A set of tests is executed due to the completion of a coding incre-ment such as a class layer or service, the completed integration of a subsys-tem, the complete implementation of the whole system, or the delivery of the system to the customer.
* _Artifact_. A unit of code (corresponding to a module in the architecture), a subsystem, or the whole system is the artifact being tested.
* _Environment_. The test can happen at development time, at compile time, at deployment time, or while the system is running (perhaps in routine use). The environment can also include the test harness or test environments in use.
* _Response_. The system can be controlled to perform the desired tests and the results from the test can be observed.
* _Response measure_. Response measures are aimed at representing how eas-ily a system under test “gives up” its faults. Measures might include the effort involved in finding a fault or a particular class of faults, the effort required to test a given percentage of statements, the length of the longest test chain (a measure of the difficulty of performing the tests), measures of effort to perform the tests, measures of effort to actually find faults, esti-mates of the probability of finding additional faults, and the length of time or amount of effort to prepare the test environment.  
Maybe one measure is the ease at which the system can be brought into a specific state. In addition, measures of the reduction in risk of the remain-ing errors in the system can be used. Not all faults are equal in terms of their possible impact. Measures of risk reduction attempt to rate the severity of faults found (or to be found).

Figure 10.2 shows a concrete scenario for testability. The unit tester com-pletes a code unit during development and performs a test sequence whose results are captured and that gives 85 percent path coverage within three hours of testing.

Table 10.1 enumerates the elements of the general scenario that characterize testability.

TABLE 10.1 Testability General Scenario
Portion of Scenario | Possible Values
---|---
Source | Unit testers, integration testers, system testers, acceptance testers, end users, either running tests manually or using automated testing tools
Stimulus | A set of tests is executed due to the completion of a coding increment such as a class layer or service, the completed integration of a subsystem, the complete implementation of the whole system, or the delivery of the system to the customer.
Environment | Design time, development time, compile time, integration time, deployment time, run time
Artifacts | The portion of the system being tested
Response | One or more of the following: execute test suite and capture results, capture activity that resulted in the fault, control and monitor the state of the system
Response | Measure One or more of the following: effort to find a fault or class of faults, effort to achieve a given percentage of state space coverage, probability of fault being revealed by the next test, time to perform tests, effort to detect faults, length of longest dependency chain in test, length of time to prepare test environment, reduction in risk exposure (size(loss) × prob(loss))

13 Architectural Tactics and Patterns 架构技巧和模式

_I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work._

There are many ways to do design badly, and just a few ways to do it well. Because success in architectural design is complex and challenging, designers have been looking for ways to capture and reuse hard-won architectural knowledge. Architectural patterns and tactics are ways of capturing proven good design structures, so that they can be reused.

Architectural patterns have seen increased interest and attention, from both software practitioners and theorists, over the past 15 years or more. An architectural pattern

* is a package of design decisions that is found repeatedly in practice,
* has known properties that permit reuse, and
* describes a class of architectures.

Because patterns are (by definition) found in practice, one does not invent them; one discovers them. Cataloging patterns is akin to the job of a Linnaean botanist or zoologist: “discovering” patterns and describing their shared characteristics. And like the botanist, zoologist, or ecologist, the pattern cataloger strives to understand how the characteristics lead to different behaviors and different responses to environmental conditions. For this reason there will never be a complete list of patterns: patterns spontaneously emerge in reaction to environmental conditions, and as long as those conditions change, new patterns will emerge.

Architectural design seldom starts from first principles. Experienced architects typically think of creating an architecture as a process of selecting, tailoring, and combining patterns. The software architect must decide how to instantiate a pattern—how to make it fit with the specific context and the constraints of the problem.

In Chapters 5–11 we have seen a variety of architectural tactics. These are simpler than patterns. Tactics typically use just a single structure or computational mechanism, and they are meant to address a single architectural force. For this reason they give more precise control to an architect when making design decisions than patterns, which typically combine multiple design decisions into a package. Tactics are the “building blocks” of design, from which architectural patterns are created. Tactics are atoms and patterns are molecules. Most patterns consist of (are constructed from) several different tactics. For this reason we say that patterns package tactics.

In this chapter we will take a very brief tour through the patterns universe, touching on some of the most important and most commonly used patterns for architecture, and we will then look at the relationships between patterns and tactics: showing how a pattern is constructed from tactics, and showing how tactics can be used to tailor patterns when the pattern that you find in a book or on a website doesn’t quite address your design needs.

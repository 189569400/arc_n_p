1. Build a spreadsheet for the steady-state availability equation $MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)$. Plug in different but reasonable values for $MTBF$ and $MTTR$ for each of the active redundancy, passive redundancy, and cold spare tactics. Try values for MTBF that are very large compared to $MTTR$, and also try values for MTBF that are much closer in size to $MTTR$. 
  What do these tell you about which tactics you might want to choose for availability?
2. Enumerate as many responsibilities as you can that need to be carried out for providing a “cancel” operation in a user interface. _Hint_: There are at least 21 of them, as indicated in a publication by (_strong hint!_) one of the authors of this book whose last name (_unbelievably strong hint!_) begins with “B.”
3. The M/M/1 (look it up!) queuing model has been employed in computing systems for decades. Where in your favorite computing system would this model be appropriate to use to predict latency?
4. Suppose an architect produced Figure 14.5 while you were sitting watching him. Using thought experiments, how can you determine the performance and availability of this system? What assumptions are you making and what conclusions can you draw? How definite are your conclusions?

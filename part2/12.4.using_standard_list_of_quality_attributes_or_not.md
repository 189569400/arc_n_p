12.4 using Standard Lists of Quality Attributes—or Not 是否使用质量属性的标准列表
===

Architects have no shortage of lists of quality attributes for software systems at their disposal. The standard with the pause-and-take-a-breath title of “ISO/IEC FCD 25010: Systems and software engineering—Systems and software product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)—System and software quality models,” is a good example. The standard divides quality attributes into those supporting a “quality in use” model and those supporting a “product quality” model. That division is a bit of a stretch in some places, but nevertheless begins a divide-and-conquer march through a breathtaking array of qualities. See Figure 12.1 for this array.

The standard lists the following quality attributes that deal with product quality:
* _Functional suitability_. The degree to which a product or system provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions
* _Performance efficiency_. Performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions
* _Compatibility_. The degree to which a product, system, or component can exchange information with other products, systems, or components, and/or perform its required functions, while sharing the same hardware or software environment
* _Usability_. The degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfac-tion in a specified context of use

* _Reliability_. The degree to which a system, product, or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time
* _Security_. The degree to which a product or system protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization
* _Maintainability_. The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers
* _Portability_. The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a system, product, or component can be transferred from one hardware, software, or other operational or usage environment to another 

In ISO 25010, these “quality characteristics” are each composed of “qual-ity subcharacteristics” (for example, nonrepudiation is a subcharacteristic of se-curity). The standard slogs through almost five dozen separate descriptions of quality subcharacteristics in this way. It defines for us the qualities of “pleasure” and “comfort.” It distinguishes among “functional correctness” and “functional completeness,” and then adds “functional appropriateness” for good measure. To exhibit “compatibility,” systems must either have “interoperability” or just plain “coexistence.” “Usability” is a product quality, not a quality-in-use quality, al-though it includes “satisfaction,” which is a quality-in-use quality. “Modifiabil-ity” and “testability” are both part of “maintainability.” So is “modularity,” which is a strategy for achieving a quality rather than a goal in its own right. “Avail-ability” is part of “reliability.” “Interoperability” is part of “compatibility.” And “scalability” isn’t mentioned at all.

Got all that?

Lists like these—and there are many—do serve a purpose. They can be help-ful checklists to assist requirements gatherers in making sure that no important needs were overlooked. Even more useful than standalone lists, they can serve as the basis for creating your own checklist that contains the quality attributes of concern in your domain, your industry, your organization, and your products. Quality attribute lists can also serve as the basis for establishing measures. If “pleasure” turns out to be an important concern in your system, how do you mea-sure it to know if your system is providing enough of it?

However, general lists like these also have drawbacks. First, no list will ever be complete. As an architect, you will be called upon to design a system to meet a stakeholder concern not foreseen by any list-maker. For example, some writers speak of “manageability,” which expresses how easy it is for system administra-tors to manage the application. This can be achieved by inserting useful instru-mentation for monitoring operation and for debugging and performance tuning. We know of an architecture that was designed with the conscious goal of retain-ing key staff and attracting talented new hires to a quiet region of the American Midwest. That system’s architects spoke of imbuing the system with “Iowabil-ity.” They achieved it by bringing in state-of-the-art technology and giving their development teams wide creative latitude. Good luck finding “Iowability” in any standard list of quality attributes, but that QA was as important to that organiza-tion as any other.

Second, lists often generate more controversy than understanding. You might argue persuasively that “functional correctness” should be part of “reliabil-ity,” or that “portability” is just a kind of “modifiability,” or that “maintainability” is a kind of “modifiability” (not the other way around). The writers of ISO 25010 apparently spent time and effort deciding to make security its own characteristic, instead of a subcharacteristic of functionality, which it was in a previous version. We believe that effort in making these arguments could be better spent elsewhere.

Third, these lists often purport to be _taxonomies_, which are lists with the special property that every member can be assigned to exactly one place. Quality attributes are notoriously squishy in this regard. We discussed denial of service as being part of security, availability, performance, and usability in Chapter 4.

Finally, these lists force architects to pay attention to every quality attribute on the list, even if only to finally decide that the particular quality attribute is ir-relevant to their system. Knowing how to quickly decide that a quality attribute is irrelevant to a specific system is a skill gained over time.

These observations reinforce the lesson introduced in Chapter 4 that quality attribute names, by themselves, are largely useless and are at best invitations to begin a conversation; that spending time worrying about what qualities are sub-qualities of what other qualities is also almost useless; and that scenarios provide the best way for us to specify precisely what we mean when we speak of a quality attribute.

Use standard lists of quality attributes to the extent that they are helpful as checklists, but don’t feel the need to slavishly adhere to their terminology.

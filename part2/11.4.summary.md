Architectural support for usability involves both allowing the user to take the ini-tiative—in circumstances such as canceling a long-running command or undoing a completed command—and aggregating data and commands.

To be able to predict user or system responses, the system must keep an ex- plicit model of the user, the system, and the task.

There is a strong relationship between supporting the user interface design process and supporting modifiability; this relation is promoted by patterns that enforce separation of the user interface from the rest of the system, such as the MVC pattern.

1. Write a set of concrete scenarios for availability using each of the possible responses in the general scenario.
2. Write a concrete availability scenario for the software for a (hypothetical) pilotless passenger aircraft.
3. Write a concrete availability scenario for a program like Microsoft Word.
4. Redundancy is often cited as a key strategy for achieving high availability. Look at the tactics presented in this chapter and decide how many of them exploit some form of redundancy and how many do not.
5. How does availability trade off against modifiability? How would you make a change to a system that is required to have “24/7” availability (no scheduled or unscheduled downtime, ever)?
6. Create a fault tree for an automatic teller machine. Include faults dealing with hardware component failure, communications failure, software failure, running out of supplies, user errors, and security attacks. How would you modify your automatic teller machine design to accommodate these faults?
7. Consider the fault detection tactics (ping/echo, heartbeat, system monitor, voting, and exception detection). What are the performance implications of using these tactics?

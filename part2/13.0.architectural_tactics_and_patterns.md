_I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work._  
_我没有失败。我只是找到了一万种行不通的方法。_

—Thomas Edison 托马斯·爱迪生

There are many ways to do design badly, and just a few ways to do it well. Because success in architectural design is complex and challenging, designers have been looking for ways to capture and reuse hard-won architectural knowledge. Architectural patterns and tactics are ways of capturing proven good design structures, so that they can be reused.

有很多方法可以让设计做得不好，只有少数几种方法可以让设计做得好。由于架构设计的成功既复杂又具有挑战性，设计师们一直在寻找获取和重用来之不易的架构知识的方法。架构模式和策略是获取经验证的良好设计结构的方法，以便它们可以重用。

Architectural patterns have seen increased interest and attention, from both software practitioners and theorists, over the past 15 years or more. An architectural pattern

在过去15年或更长的时间里，软件从业者和理论家对架构模式的兴趣和关注不断增加。架构模式

* is a package of design decisions that is found repeatedly in practice,
   是一套在实践中反复出现的设计决策，
* has known properties that permit reuse, and
   具有允许重复使用的已知属性，以及
* describes a class of architectures.
   描述了一类体系结构。

Because patterns are (by definition) found in practice, one does not invent them; one discovers them. Cataloging patterns is akin to the job of a Linnaean botanist or zoologist: “discovering” patterns and describing their shared characteristics. And like the botanist, zoologist, or ecologist, the pattern cataloger strives to understand how the characteristics lead to different behaviors and different responses to environmental conditions. For this reason there will never be a complete list of patterns: patterns spontaneously emerge in reaction to environmental conditions, and as long as those conditions change, new patterns will emerge.

因为模式（根据定义）是在实践中发现的，所以人们不会发明它们；人们发现了它们。对模式进行编目类似于林奈植物学家或动物学家的工作：“发现”模式并描述它们的共同特征。和植物学家、动物学家或生态学家一样，模式编目员努力理解这些特征如何导致不同的行为和对环境条件的不同反应。因此，永远不会有一个完整的模式列表：模式会随着环境条件的变化而自发出现，只要这些条件发生变化，新的模式就会出现。

Architectural design seldom starts from first principles. Experienced architects typically think of creating an architecture as a process of selecting, tailoring, and combining patterns. The software architect must decide how to instantiate a pattern—how to make it fit with the specific context and the constraints of the problem.

架构设计很少从第一原则开始。经验丰富的架构师通常认为创建架构是一个选择、裁剪和组合模式的过程。软件架构师必须决定如何实例化一个模式，如何使其适合特定的上下文和问题的约束。

In Chapters 5–11 we have seen a variety of architectural tactics. These are simpler than patterns. Tactics typically use just a single structure or computational mechanism, and they are meant to address a single architectural force. For this reason they give more precise control to an architect when making design decisions than patterns, which typically combine multiple design decisions into a package. Tactics are the “building blocks” of design, from which architectural patterns are created. Tactics are atoms and patterns are molecules. Most patterns consist of (are constructed from) several different tactics. For this reason we say that patterns package tactics.

在第5-11章中，我们看到了各种各样的架构策略。这些都比模式简单。策略通常只使用单一的结构或计算机制，旨在解决单一的架构力量。因此，在设计决策时，它们比模式（通常将多个设计决策组合到一个包中）给予架构师更精确的控制。策略是设计的“积木”，从中创建架构模式。策略是原子，模式是分子。大多数模式由几种不同的策略组成。出于这个原因，我们说模式是一包的策略。

In this chapter we will take a very brief tour through the patterns universe, touching on some of the most important and most commonly used patterns for architecture, and we will then look at the relationships between patterns and tactics: showing how a pattern is constructed from tactics, and showing how tactics can be used to tailor patterns when the pattern that you find in a book or on a website doesn’t quite address your design needs.

在本章中，我们将对模式世界进行一次非常简短的参观，涉及一些最重要和最常用的架构模式，然后我们将研究模式与策略之间的关系：展示如何从策略构建模式，当你在一本书或一个网站上找到的模式不能完全满足你的设计需求时，展示如何使用策略来定制模式。

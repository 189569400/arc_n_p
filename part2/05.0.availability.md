Availability refers to a property of software that it is there and ready to carry out its task when you need it to be. This is a broad perspective and encompasses what is normally called reliability (although it may encompass additional considerations such as downtime due to periodic maintenance). In fact, availability builds upon the concept of reliability by adding the notion of recovery—that is, when the system breaks, it repairs itself. Repair may be accomplished by various means, which we’ll see in this chapter. More precisely, Avižienis and his colleagues have defined dependability:

可用性指的是：可以在需要时使用它并准备执行其任务的软件属性。 这是一个广阔的视角，涵盖了通常所说的可靠性（尽管它可能包含其他考虑因素，例如由于定期维护而导致的停机）。 实际上，可用性通过添加恢复的概念建立在可靠性的概念上，也就是说，当系统崩溃时，它会自我修复。 维修可以通过多种方式完成，我们将在本章中介绍。 更准确地说，Avižienis和他的同事定义了可靠性：

Dependability is the ability to avoid failures that are more frequent and more severe than is acceptable.

可靠性是避免发生比可接受的更为频繁和严重的故障的能力。

Our definition of availability as an aspect of dependability is this: “Availability refers to the ability of a system to mask or repair faults such that the cumulative service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time interval.” These definitions make the concept of failure subject to the judgment of an external agent, possibly a human. They also subsume concepts of reliability, confidentiality, integrity, and any other quality attribute that involves a concept of unacceptable failure.

我们将可用性定义为可靠性的一个方面是：“可用性是指系统掩盖或修复故障的能力，以使累积的服务中断时间段在指定的时间间隔内不超过要求的值。” 失败的概念取决于外部因素（可能是人类）的判断。 它们还包含可靠性、机密性、完整性和涉及不可接受的故障的任何其他质量属性的概念。

Availability is closely related to security. A denial-of-service attack is explicitly designed to make a system fail—that is, to make it unavailable. Availability is also closely related to performance, because it may be difficult to tell when a system has failed and when it is simply being outrageously slow to respond. Finally, availability is closely allied with safety, which is concerned with keeping the system from entering a hazardous state and recovering or limiting the damage when it does.

可用性与安全性密切相关。 拒绝服务攻击是专门设计用来使系统发生故障的，也就是使其不可用。 可用性也与性能密切相关，因为可能很难分辨出系统何时发生故障以及何时响应变得异常缓慢。 最后，可用性与安全性密切相关，安全性与防止系统进入危险状态以及在系统损坏时恢复或限制损坏有关。

Fundamentally, availability is about minimizing service outage time by mitigating faults. Failure implies visibility to a system or human observer in the environment. That is, a failure is the deviation of the system from its specification, where the deviation is externally visible. One of the most demanding tasks in building a high-availability, fault-tolerant system is to understand the nature of the failures that can arise during operation (see the sidebar “Planning for Failure”). Once those are understood, mitigation strategies can be designed into the software.

从根本上讲，可用性是通过减少故障来最大程度地减少服务中断时间。 故障意味着对环境中的系统或人类观察者可见。 也就是说，故障是系统与其规格的偏差，该偏差在外部是可见的。 构建高可用性，容错系统中最艰巨的任务之一是了解操作过程中可能发生的故障的性质（请参见侧栏“故障规划”）。 一旦了解了这些，就可以将缓解策略设计到软件中。

A failure’s cause is called a fault. A fault can be either internal or external to the system under consideration. Intermediate states between the occurrence of a fault and the occurrence of a failure are called errors. Faults can be prevented, tolerated, removed, or forecast. In this way a system becomes “resilient” to faults.

故障的原因称为故障。 故障可能是正在考虑的系统内部故障或外部故障。 故障发生与故障发生之间的中间状态称为错误。 可以预防，容忍，消除或预测故障。 这样，系统就可以“容忍”故障。

Among the areas with which we are concerned are how system faults are detected, how frequently system faults may occur, what happens when a fault occurs, how long a system is allowed to be out of operation, when faults or failures may occur safely, how faults or failures can be prevented, and what kinds of notifications are required when a failure occurs.

我们关注的领域包括如何检测系统故障，系统故障可能发生的频率，发生故障时发生的情况，允许系统停机多长时间，何时可以安全地发生故障或故障，如何进行检测。 可以防止出现故障或故障，并且可以防止发生故障时需要发出何种通知。

Because a system failure is observable by users, the time to repair is the time until the failure is no longer observable. This may be a brief delay in the response time or it may be the time it takes someone to fly to a remote location in the Andes to repair a piece of mining machinery (as was recounted to us by a person responsible for repairing the software in a mining machine engine). The notion of “observability” can be a tricky one: the Stuxnet virus, as an example, went unobserved for a very long time even though it was doing damage. In addition, we are often concerned with the level of capability that remains when a failure has occurred—a degraded operating mode.

由于用户可以观察到系统故障，因此修复时间就是直到不再可见故障为止的时间。 这可能是响应时间的短暂延迟，也可能是某人飞往安第斯山脉的偏远地点修理一台采矿机械的时间（正如负责维修该软件的人员向我们讲述的那样）。 采矿机引擎）。 “可观察性”的概念可能是一个棘手的概念：例如，Stuxnet病毒即使造成损害，也很长时间没有被观察到。 此外，我们经常担心故障发生时所保持的能力水平（运行模式降级）。

The distinction between faults and failures allows discussion of automatic repair strategies. That is, if code containing a fault is executed but the system is able to recover from the fault without any deviation from specified behavior being observable, there is no failure.

故障与故障之间的区别允许讨论自动修复策略。 即，如果执行了包含故障的代码，但是系统能够从故障中恢复，而不会观察到与指定行为的任何偏差，则不会出现故障。

The availability of a system can be calculated as the probability that it will provide the specified services within required bounds over a specified time interval. When referring to hardware, there is a well-known expression used to derive steady-state availability:

可以将系统的可用性计算为系统将在指定时间间隔内在要求范围内提供指定服务的概率。 当提到硬件时，有一个众所周知的表达式可用来导出稳态可用性：

$
\frac {MTBF} {MTBF + MTTR}
$

where MTBF refers to the mean time between failures and MTTR refers to the mean time to repair. In the software world, this formula should be interpreted to mean that when thinking about availability, you should think about what will make your system fail, how likely that is to occur, and that there will be some time required to repair it.

其中MTBF是指平均故障间隔时间，MTTR是指平均修复时间。 在软件世界中，应将此公式解释为意味着在考虑可用性时，您应考虑使系统发生故障的原因，发生故障的可能性以及修复该故障所需的时间。

From this formula it is possible to calculate probabilities and make claims like “99.999 percent availability,” or a 0.001 percent probability that the system will not be operational when needed. Scheduled downtimes (when the system is intentionally taken out of service) may not be considered when calculating availability, because the system is deemed “not needed” then; of course, this depends on the specific requirements for the system, often encoded in service-level agreements (SLAs). This arrangement may lead to seemingly odd situations where the system is down and users are waiting for it, but the downtime is scheduled and so is not counted against any availability requirements.

根据此公式，可以计算出概率，并做出诸如“ 99.999％的可用性”之类的索赔，或者提出系统在需要时无法运行的0.001％的概率。 在计算可用性时，可以不考虑计划内的停机时间（有意使系统退出服务时），因为那时系统被认为“不需要”。 当然，这取决于系统的特定要求，通常是在服务级别协议（SLA）中进行编码的。 这种安排可能会导致看似奇怪的情况，其中系统已关闭且用户正在等待它，但是停机时间是有计划的，因此不计入任何可用性要求。

In operational systems, faults are detected and correlated prior to being reported and repaired. Fault correlation logic will categorize a fault according to its severity (critical, major, or minor) and service impact (service-affecting or non-service-affecting) in order to provide the system operator with timely and accurate system status and allow for the appropriate repair strategy to be employed. The repair strategy may be automated or may require manual intervention.

在操作系统中，在报告和修复故障之前，先对其进行检测和关联。 故障关联逻辑将根据故障的严重性（严重，重大或次要）和服务影响（影响服务或不影响服务）对故障进行分类，以便为系统操作员提供及时，准确的系统状态并允许 采取适当的维修策略。 维修策略可能是自动化的，也可能需要手动干预。

The availability provided by a computer system or hosting service is frequently expressed as a service-level agreement. This SLA specifies the availability level that is guaranteed and, usually, the penalties that the computer system or hosting service will suffer if the SLA is violated. The SLA that Amazon provides for its EC2 cloud service is

计算机系统或托管服务提供的可用性通常表示为服务级别协议。 此SLA指定了可以保证的可用性级别，通常，如果违反了SLA，则计算机系统或托管服务将遭受的惩罚。 亚马逊为其EC2云服务提供的SLA是

> AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make Amazon EC2 available with an Annual Uptime Percentage [defined elsewhere] of at least 99.95% during the Service Year. In the event Amazon EC2 does not meet the Annual Uptime Percentage commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.

> AWS将通过商业上合理的努力来使Amazon EC2在服务年度内的年度正常运行率百分比（在其他地方定义）至少为99.95％。 如果Amazon EC2不符合年度正常运行时间百分比承诺，您将有资格获得如下所述的服务信用。

Table 5.1 provides examples of system availability requirements and associated threshold values for acceptable system downtime, measured over observation periods of 90 days and one year. The term high availability typically refers to designs targeting availability of 99.999 percent (“5 nines”) or greater. By definition or convention, only unscheduled outages contribute to system downtime.

表5.1提供了系统可用性要求的示例，以及在90天和一年的观察期内测得的可接受的系统停机相关阈值。 术语“高可用性”通常是指以99.999％（“ 5个9”）或更高的可用性为目标的设计。 根据定义或约定，只有计划外的停机会导致系统停机。

> **Planning for Failure 计划失败**

> When designing a high-availability or safety-critical system, it’s tempting to say that failure is not an option. It’s a catchy phrase, but it’s a lousy design philosophy. In fact, failure is not only an option, it’s almost inevitable. What will make your system safe and available is planning for the occurrence of failure or (more likely) failures, and handling them with aplomb. The first step is to understand what kinds of failures your system is prone to, and what the consequences of each will be. Here are three well-known techniques for getting a handle on this.

> Hazard analysis is a technique that attempts to catalog the hazards that can occur during the operation of a system. It categorizes each hazard according to its severity. For example, the DO-178B standard used in the aeronautics industry defines these failure condition levels in terms of their effects on the aircraft, crew, and passengers:

>   _灾难性的_。 这种故障可能会导致崩溃。 该故障表示安全飞行和降落飞机所需的关键功能丧失。
> * _Hazardous_. This kind of failure has a large negative impact on safety or performance, or reduces the ability of the crew to operate the aircraft due to physical distress or a higher workload, or causes serious or fatal injuries among the passengers.
>    _危险_。 这种故障会对安全或性能造成很大的负面影响，或者由于身体不适或工作量增加而降低机组人员操作飞机的能力，或者对乘客造成严重或致命的伤害。
> * _Major_. This kind of failure is significant, but has a lesser impact than a Hazardous failure (for example, leads to passenger discomfort rather than injuries) or significantly increases crew workload to the point where safety is affected.
>    _重大的_。 这种故障是重大的，但其影响要小于危险故障（例如，导致乘客不适而不是受伤），或者会大大增加机组人员的工作量，以至影响安全。
> * _Minor_. This kind of failure is noticeable, but has a lesser impact than a Major failure (for example, causing passenger inconvenience or a routine flight plan change).
>    _次要_。 这种故障很明显，但比重大故障（例如，造成乘客不便或更改常规航班计划）的影响要小。
> * _No effect_. This kind of failure has no impact on safety, aircraft operation, or crew workload.
>    _没有影响_。 这种故障不会影响安全性，飞机运行或机组人员的工作量。

> _Fault tree analysis_  
> _故障树分析_
> Fault tree analysis is an analytical technique that specifies a state of the system that negatively impacts safety or reliability, and then analyzes the system’s context and operation to find all the ways that the undesired state could occur. The technique uses a graphic construct (the fault tree) that helps identify all sequential and parallel sequences of contributing faults that will result in the occurrence of the undesired state, which is listed at the top of the tree (the “top event”). The contributing faults might be hardware failures, human errors, software errors, or any other pertinent events that can lead to the undesired state.

> 故障树分析是一种分析技术，它指定对安全性或可靠性有负面影响的系统状态，然后分析系统的上下文和操作以查找可能发生不良状态的所有方式。 该技术使用图形结构（故障树），该结构有助于识别所有导致故障的顺序和并行序列，这些故障将导致出现不希望的状态，该状态列在树的顶部（“顶部事件”）。 导致故障的原因可能是硬件故障，人为错误，软件错误或任何其他可能导致不良状态的相关事件。

> 
> A fault tree lends itself to static analysis in various ways. For example, a “minimal cut set” is the smallest combination of events along the bottom of the tree that together can cause the top event. The set of minimal cut sets shows all the ways the bottom events can combine to cause the overarching failure. Any singleton minimal cut set reveals a single point of failure, which should be carefully scrutinized. Also, the probabilities of various contributing failures can be combined to come up with a probability of the top event occurring. Dynamic analysis occurs when the order of contributing failures matters. In this case, techniques such as Markov analysis can be used to calculate probability of failure over different failure sequences.

13.4 Using Tactics Together
===

Tactics, as described in Chapters 5–11, are design primitives aimed at managing a single quality attribute response. Of course, this is almost never true in prac-tice; every tactic has its main effect—to manage modifiability or performance or safety, and so on—and it has its side effects, its tradeoffs. On the face of it, the situation for an architect sounds hopeless. Whatever you do to improve one quality attribute endangers another. We are able to use tactics profitably because we can gauge the direct and side effects of a tactic, and when the tradeoff is ac-ceptable, we employ the tactic. In doing so we gain some benefit in our quality attribute of interest while giving up something else (with respect to a different quality attribute and, we hope, of a much smaller magnitude).

This section will walk through an example that shows how applying tactics to a pattern can produce negative effects in one area, but how adding other tactics can bring relief and put you back in an acceptable design space. The point is to show the interplay between tactics that you can use to your advantage. Just as some combinations of liquids are noxious whereas others yield lovely things like strawberry lemonade, tactics can either make things worse or put you in a happy design space. Here, then, is a walkthrough of tactic mixology.

Consider a system that needs to detect faults in its components. A common tactic for detecting faults is ping/echo. Let us assume that the architect has de-cided to employ ping/echo as a way to detect failed components in the system. Every tactic has one or more side effects, and ping/echo is no different. Common considerations associated with ping/echo are these:
* _Security_. How to prevent a ping flood attack?
* _Performance_. How to ensure that the performance overhead of ping/echo is small?
* _Modifiability_. How to add ping/echo to the existing architecture?

We can represent the architect’s reasoning and decisions thus far as shown
in Figure 13.17.

FIGURE 13.17 Partial availability decisions

Suppose the architect determines that the performance tradeoff (the overhead of adding ping/echo to the system) is the most severe. A tactic to address the performance side effect is increase available resources. Considerations associated with increase available resources are these:
* _Cost_. Increased resources cost more.
* _Performance_. How to utilize the increased resources efficiently?

This set of design decisions can now be represented as shown in Figure 13.18.

Now the architect chooses to deal with the resource utilization consequence of employing increase available resources. These resources must be used efficiently or else they are simply adding cost and complexity to the system. A tactic that can address the efficient use of resources is the employment of a scheduling policy. Con-siderations associated with the scheduling policy tactic are these:
* _Modifiability_. How to add the scheduling policy to the existing architecture?
* _Modifiability_. How to change the scheduling policy in the future?

FIGURE 13.18 More availability decisions

The set of design decisions that includes the scheduling policy tactic can now be represented as in Figure 13.19.

Next the architect chooses to deal with the modifiability consequence of employing a scheduling policy tactic. A tactic to address the addition of the scheduler to the system is to use an intermediary, which will insulate the choice of scheduling policy from the rest of the system. One consideration associated with use an intermediary is this:
* _Modifiability_. How to ensure that all communication passes through the intermediary?

FIGURE 13.19 Still more availability decisions

We can now represent the tactics-based set of architectural design decisions made thus far as in Figure 13.20.

A tactic to address the concern that all communication passes through the intermediary is restrict dependencies. One consideration associated with the restrict dependencies tactic is this:
* _Performance_. How to ensure that the performance overhead of the intermediary is not excessive?

This design problem has now become recursive! At this point (or in fact, at any point in the tree of design decisions that we have described) the architect might determine that the performance overhead of the intermediary is small enough that no further design decisions need to be made.

Applying successive tactics is like moving through a game space, and it’s a little like chess: Good players are able to see the consequences of the move they’re considering, and the very good players are able to look several moves ahead. In Chapter 17 we’ll see the activity of design treated as an exercise of “generate and test”: propose a design and test it to see if it’s satisfactory. Applying tactics to an existing design solution, such as a pattern, is one technique for generating a design for subsequent testing.

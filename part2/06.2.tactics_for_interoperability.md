Figure 6.2 Goal of interoperability tactics 互操作策略的目标

We identify two categories of interoperability tactics: locate and manage interfaces.

我们确定了两类互操作性策略：查找和管理接口。

**Locate 定位**

There is only one tactic in this category: _discover service_. It is used when the systems that interoperate must be discovered at runtime.

此类别中只有一种策略：_发现服务_。 当必须在运行时发现可互操作的系统时使用它。

* _Discover service_. Locate a service through searching a known directory service. (By “service,” we simply mean a set of capabilities that is accessible via some kind of interface.) There may be multiple levels of indirection in this location process—that is, a known location points to another location that in turn can be searched for the service. The service can be located by type of service, by name, by location, or by some other attribute.
* _发现服务_。 通过搜索已知的目录服务来找到服务。 （通过“服务”，我们简单地表示可以通过某种接口访问的一组功能。）在此定位过程中可能存在多个间接级别，即，已知位置指向另一个位置，而该位置又可以 搜索服务。 可以通过服务类型，名称，位置或其他属性来定位服务。

**Manage Interfaces 管理接口**

Managing interfaces consists of two tactics: orchestrate and tailor interface.

管理接口包括两种策略：编排和剪裁接口。

* _Orchestrate_. Orchestrate is a tactic that uses a control mechanism to coordinate and manage and sequence the invocation of particular services (which could be ignorant of each other). Orchestration is used when the interoperating systems must interact in a complex fashion to accomplish a complex task; orchestration “scripts” the interaction. Workflow engines are an example of the use of the orchestrate tactic. The mediator design pattern can serve this function for simple orchestration. Complex orchestration can be specified in a language such as BPEL.
* _编排_。 Orchestrate是一种策略，它使用控制机制来协调和管理特定服务的调用并对其进行排序（这些服务可能彼此不了解）。 当互操作系统必须以复杂的方式交互以完成复杂的任务时，将使用编排。 编排“脚本”交互。 工作流引擎是使用协调策略的一个示例。 介体设计模式可以充当简单编排的功能。 可以使用诸如BPEL之类的语言来指定复杂的业务流程。
* _Tailor interface_. Tailor interface is a tactic that adds or removes capabilities to an interface. Capabilities such as translation, adding buffering, or smoothing data can be added. Capabilities may be removed as well. An example of removing capabilities is to hide particular functions from untrusted users. The decorator pattern is an example of the tailor interface tactic.
* _剪裁接口_。 剪裁接口是一种在接口上添加或删除功能的策略。 可以添加诸如转换，添加缓冲或平滑数据之类的功能。 功能也可能被删除。 删除功能的一个示例是向不受信任的用户隐藏特定功能。 装饰器模式是定制界面策略的一个示例。

The enterprise service bus that underlies many service-oriented architectures combines both of the manage interface tactics.

基于许多面向服务的体系结构的企业服务总线结合了两种管理接口策略。

> Developer of System A needs to exchange product data with System B. Developer A finds that there is an existing WS* web service interface for sending product data that among other fields contains price expressed in XML Schema as a decimal with two fraction digits. Developer A writes code to interact with the web service and the system works perfectly. However, after two weeks of operation, there is a huge discrepancy between the totals reported by System A and the totals reported by System B. After conversations between the two developers, they discover that System B expected to receive a price that included tax and System A was sending it without tax.

> 系统A的开发人员需要与系统B交换产品数据。开发人员A发现存在用于发送产品数据的WS* Web服务接口，该接口在其他字段中包含以XML Schema表示的价格（用两位小数表示）。 开发人员A编写了与Web服务交互的代码，并且系统运行良好。 但是，在运行两周后，系统A报告的总数与系统B报告的总数之间存在巨大差异。在两个开发人员进行交谈之后，他们发现系统B期望收到的含税价格但和系统A发送的价格不含税。

> This is a simple example of why standards are not enough. The systems exchanged data perfectly because they both agreed that the price was a decimal with two fractions digits expressed in XML Schema and the message was sent via SOAP over HTTP (syntax)—standards used in the implementation of WS* web services—but they did not agree on whether the price included tax or not (semantics).
>
> 这是为什么标准不足的一个简单示例。 这些系统完美地交换了数据，因为它们都同意价格是XML Schema中表示的两位十进制的小数位数，并且消息是通过SOAP over HTTP（语法）通过SOAP发送的（WS* Web服务实现中使用的标准），但是他们确实在价格是否包含税（语义学）上没有达成一致。

> Of course, the only realistic approach to getting diverse applications to share information is by reaching agreements on the structure and function of the information to be shared. These agreements are often reflected in standards that provide a common interface that multiple vendors and application builders support. Standards have indeed been instrumental in achieving a significant level of interoperability that we rely on in almost every domain. However, while standards are useful and in many ways indispensable, expectations of what can be achieved through standards are unrealistic. Here are some of the challenges that organizations face related to standards and interoperability:
>
> 当然，使各种应用程序共享信息的唯一现实方法是就要共享的信息的结构和功能达成协议。 这些协议通常反映在提供多个供应商和应用程序构建者支持的通用接口的标准中。 标准确实在实现我们几乎在每个领域中都依赖的显着水平的互操作性方面发挥了作用。 然而，尽管标准是有用的并且在许多方面是必不可少的，但是对通过标准可以实现的目标的期望却是不现实的。 以下是组织面临的与标准和互操作性有关的一些挑战：
>
> 1. Ideally, every implementation of a standard should be identical and thus completely interoperable with any other implementation. However, this is far from reality. Standards, when incorporated into products, tools, and services, undergo customizations and extensions because every vendor wants to create a unique selling point as a competitive advantage.  
> 1.理想情况下，标准的每个实现都应该相同，因此可以与任何其他实现完全互操作。 但是，这远非现实。 当标准结合到产品，工具和服务中时，会进行自定义和扩展，因为每个供应商都希望创建一个独特的卖点作为竞争优势。
> 2. Standards are often deliberately open-ended and provide extension points. The actual implementation of these extension points is left to the discretion of implementers, leading to proprietary implementations.  
> 2.标准通常是故意开放式的，并提供扩展点。 这些扩展点的实际实现方式由实施者自行决定，以实现专有的实现。
> 3. Standards, like any technology, have a life cycle of their own and evolve over time in compatible and noncompatible ways. Deciding when to adopt a new or revised standard is a critical decision for organizations. Committing to a new standard that is not ready or eventually not adopted by the community is a big risk for organizations. On the other hand, waiting too long may also become a problem, which can lead to unsupported products, incompatibilities, and workarounds, because everyone else is using the standard.  
> 3.与任何技术一样，标准都有其自身的生命周期，并且会以兼容和不兼容的方式随时间而发展。 对于组织而言，决定何时采用新的或修订的标准是至关重要的决定。 承诺尚未准备好或最终未被社区采用的新标准对组织来说是很大的风险。 另一方面，等待时间过长也可能会成为问题，这可能会导致产品不受支持，不兼容和变通方法，因为其他所有人都在使用该标准。
> 4. Within the software community, there are as many bad standards as there are engineers with opinions. Bad standards include underspecified, overspecified, inconsistently specified, unstable, or irrelevant standards.  
> 4.在软件社区中，不良标准的数量与有意见的工程师一样多。 不良标准包括规格不足，规格过度，规格不一致，不稳定或不相关的标准。
> 5. It is quite common for standards to be championed by competing organizations, resulting in conflicting standards due to overlap or mutual exclusion.  
> 5.竞争组织拥护标准是很普遍的，由于重叠或相互排斥而导致标准冲突。
> 6. For new and rapidly emerging domains, the argument often made is that standardization will be destructive because it will hinder flexibility: premature standardization will force the use of an inadequate approach and lead to abandoning other presumably better approaches. So what do organizations do in the meantime?  
> 6.对于新兴领域和迅速崛起的领域，经常有人争辩说标准化会破坏性的，因为它会阻碍灵活性：过早的标准化将迫使使用不足的方法，并导致放弃其他可能更好的方法。 那么组织在此期间做什么呢？
>
> What these challenges illustrate is that because of the way in which standards are usually created and evolved, we cannot let standards drive our architectures. We need to architect systems first and then decide which standards can support desired system requirements and qualities. This approach allows standards to change and evolve without affecting the overall architecture of the system.
>
> 这些挑战说明，由于通常创建和发展标准的方式，我们不能让标准来驱动我们的体系结构。 我们需要先设计系统，然后再决定哪些标准可以支持所需的系统要求和质量。 这种方法允许标准在不影响系统整体体系结构的情况下进行更改和发展。

> I once heard someone in a keynote address say that “The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.”

> 我曾经在主题演讲中听到有人说：“关于标准的好处是有很多选择。”

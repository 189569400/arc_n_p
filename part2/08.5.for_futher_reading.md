Performance has a rich body of literature. Here are some books we recommend:

* *Software Performance and Scalability: A Quantitative Approach* [Liu 09]. This books covers performance geared toward enterprise applications, with an emphasis on queuing theory and measurement.
* *Performance Solutions: A Practical Guide to Creating Responsive, Scal-able Software* [Smith 01]. This book covers designing with performance in mind, with emphasis on building (and populating with real data) practical predictive performance models.
* *Real-Time Design Patterns: Robust Scalable Architecture for Real-Time Systems* [Douglass 99].
* *Real-Time Systems* [Liu 00].
* *Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 3: Patterns for Resource Management* [Kircher 03].

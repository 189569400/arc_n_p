Figure 6.2 Goal of interoperability tactics

We identify two categories of interoperability tactics: locate and manage interfaces.

**Locate**

There is only one tactic in this category: discover service. It is used when the
systems that interoperate must be discovered at runtime.

* Discover service. Locate a service through searching a known directory service. (By “service,” we simply mean a set of capabilities that is accessible via some kind of interface.) There may be multiple levels of indirection in this location process—that is, a known location points to another location that in turn can be searched for the service. The service can be located by type of service, by name, by location, or by some other attribute.

**Manage Interfaces**

Managing interfaces consists of two tactics: orchestrate and tailor interface.

* _Orchestrate_. Orchestrate is a tactic that uses a control mechanism to coordinate and manage and sequence the invocation of particular services (which could be ignorant of each other). Orchestration is used when the interoperating systems must interact in a complex fashion to accomplish a complex task; orchestration “scripts” the interaction. Workflow engines are an example of the use of the orchestrate tactic. The mediator design pattern can serve this function for simple orchestration. Complex orchestration can be specified in a language such as BPEL.
* _Tailor interface_. Tailor interface is a tactic that adds or removes capabilities to an interface. Capabilities such as translation, adding buffering, or smoothing data can be added. Capabilities may be removed as well. An example of removing capabilities is to hide particular functions from untrusted users. The decorator pattern is an example of the tailor interface tactic.

The enterprise service bus that underlies many service-oriented architectures combines both of the manage interface tactics.

Figure 6.3 shows a summary of the tactics to achieve interoperability.

> **Why Standards Are Not Enough to Guarantee Interoperability**

> Developer of System A needs to exchange product data with System B. Developer A finds that there is an existing WS* web service interface for sending product data that among other fields contains price expressed in XML Schema as a decimal with two fraction digits. Developer A writes code to interact with the web service and the system works perfectly. However, after two weeks of operation, there is a huge discrepancy between the totals reported by System A and the totals reported by System B. After conversations between the two developers, they discover that System B expected to receive a price that included tax and System A was sending it without tax.
>
> This is a simple example of why standards are not enough. The systems exchanged data perfectly because they both agreed that the price was a decimal with two fractions digits expressed in XML Schema and the message was sent via SOAP over HTTP (syntax)—standards used in the implementation of WS* web services—but they did not agree on whether the price included tax or not (semantics).
>
> Of course, the only realistic approach to getting diverse applications to share information is by reaching agreements on the structure and function of the information to be shared. These agreements are often reflected in standards that provide a common interface that multiple vendors and application builders support. Standards have indeed been instrumental in achieving a significant level of interoperability that we rely on in almost every domain. However, while standards are useful and in many ways indispensable, expectations of what can be achieved through standards are unrealistic. Here are some of the challenges that organizations face related to standards and interoperability:
>
> 1. Ideally, every implementation of a standard should be identical and thus completely interoperable with any other implementation. However, this is far from reality. Standards, when incorporated into products, tools, and services, undergo customizations and extensions because every vendor wants to create a unique selling point as a competitive advantage.
> 2. Standards are often deliberately open-ended and provide extension points. The actual implementation of these extension points is left to the discretion of implementers, leading to proprietary implementations.
> 3. Standards, like any technology, have a life cycle of their own and evolve over time in compatible and noncompatible ways. Deciding when to adopt a new or revised standard is a critical decision for organizations. Committing to a new standard that is not ready or eventually not adopted by the community is a big risk for organizations. On the other hand, waiting too long may also become a problem, which can lead to unsupported products, incompatibilities, and workarounds, because everyone else is using the standard.
> 4. Within the software community, there are as many bad standards as there are engineers with opinions. Bad standards include underspecified, overspecified, inconsistently specified, unstable, or irrelevant standards.
> 5. It is quite common for standards to be championed by competing organizations, resulting in conflicting standards due to overlap or mutual exclusion.
> 6. For new and rapidly emerging domains, the argument often made is that standardization will be destructive because it will hinder flexibility: premature standardization will force the use of an inadequate approach and lead to abandoning other presumably better approaches. So what do organizations do in the meantime?
>
> What these challenges illustrate is that because of the way in which standards are usually created and evolved, we cannot let standards drive our architectures. We need to architect systems first and then decide which standards can support desired system requirements and qualities. This approach allows standards to change and evolve without affecting the overall architecture of the system.

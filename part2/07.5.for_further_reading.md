Serious students of software engineering should read two early papers about
designing for modifiability. The first is Edsger Dijkstra’s 1968 paper about the
T.H.E. operating system [Dijkstra 68], which is the first paper that talks about designing
systems to be layered, and the modifiability benefits it brings. The second
is David Parnas’s 1972 paper that introduced the concept of information hiding
[Parnas 72]. Parnas prescribed defining modules not by their functionality but by
their ability to internalize the effects of changes.
The tactics that we have presented in this chapter are a variant on those introduced
by [Bachmann 07].
Additional tactics for modifiability within the avionics domain can be found
in [EOSAN 07], published by the European Organization for the Safety of Air
Navigation.

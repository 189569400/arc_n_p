Availability refers to the ability of the system to be available for use, especially after a fault occurs. The fault must be recognized (or prevented) and then the system must respond in some fashion. The response desired will depend on the criticality of the application and the type of fault and can range from “ignore it” to “keep on going as if it didn’t occur.”

可用性是指系统可使用的能力，尤其是在发生故障之后。 必须识别（或预防）故障，然后系统必须以某种方式进行响应。 所需的响应取决于应用程序的关键程度和故障的类型，范围从“忽略”到“继续进行，好像没有发生”。

Tactics for availability are categorized into detect faults, recover from faults and prevent faults. Detection tactics depend, essentially, on detecting signs of life from various components. Recovery tactics are some combination of retrying an operation or maintaining redundant data or computations. Prevention tactics depend either on removing elements from service or utilizing mechanisms to limit the scope of faults.

可用性策略可分为故障检测，故障恢复和故障预防。 检测策略本质上取决于从各种组件中检测生命迹象。 恢复策略是重试操作或维护冗余数据或计算的某种组合。 预防策略取决于从服务中删除元素或利用机制来限制故障范围。

All of the availability tactics involve the coordination model because the coordination model must be aware of faults that occur to generate an appropriate response.

所有的可用性策略都涉及协调模型，因为协调模型必须知道发生的故障以生成适当的响应。

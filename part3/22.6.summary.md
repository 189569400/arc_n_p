22.6 Summary 小结
===

A project must be planned, organized, implemented, tracked, and governed.

The plan for a project is initially developed as a top-down schedule with an acknowledgement that it is only an estimate. Once the decomposition of the system has been done, a bottom-up schedule can be developed. The two must be reconciled, and this becomes the basis for the software development plan.

Teams are created based on the software development plan. The software architect and the project manager must coordinate to oversee the implementation. Global development creates a need for an explicit coordination strategy that is based on more formal methods than needed for co-located development.

The implementation itself causes tradeoffs between schedule, function, and cost. Releases are done in an incremental fashion and progress is tracked by both formal metrics and informal communication.

Larger systems require formal governance mechanisms. The issue of who has control over a particular portion of the system may prevent some business goals from being realized.

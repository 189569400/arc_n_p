20.3 Database Construction
===

Some of the information extracted from the raw view extraction phase, while necessary for the process of reconstruction, may be too specific to aid in architectural understanding. Consider Figure 20.2. In this figure we show a set of facts extracted from a code base consisting of classes and methods, and inclusion and calling relations. Each element is plotted on a grid and each relation is drawn as a line between the elements. This view, while accurate, provides no insight into the overarching abstractions or coarse-grained structures present in the architecture.

Thus we need to manipulate such raw views, to collapse information (for example, hiding methods inside class definitions), and to show abstractions (for example, showing all of the connections between business objects and user interface objects, or identifying distinct layers).

It is helpful to use a database to store the extracted information because the amount of information being stored is large, and the manipulations of the data are tedious and error-prone if done manually. Some reverse-engineering tools, such as Lattix, SonarJ, and Structure101, fully encapsulate the database, and so the user of the tool need not be concerned with its operation. However, those who are using a suite of tools together—a workbench—will need to choose a database and decide on internal representations of the views.

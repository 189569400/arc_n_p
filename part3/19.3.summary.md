Architecture plays a key role in both implementation and testing. In the implementation phase, letting future readers of the code know what architectural constructs are being used, using frameworks, and using code templates all make life easier both at implementation time and during maintenance.

During testing the architecture determines what is being tested at which stage of development. Development quality attributes can be tested during unit test and runtime quality attributes can be tested during integration testing.

Testing, as with other activities in architecture-based development, is a cost/benefit activity. Do not spend as much time testing for faults whose consequences are small and spend the most time testing for faults whose consequences are serious. Do not neglect testing for faults that show up after the system has been executing for an extended period.

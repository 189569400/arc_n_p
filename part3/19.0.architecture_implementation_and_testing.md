19 架构、实现和测试 Architecture, Implementation, and Testing
===

_You don’t make progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas._  
_站在一旁哭泣和抱怨是不会有进步的。你通过实施想法来取得进步。_   
—Shirley Hufstedler 雪莉·赫夫斯特勒

Although this is a book about software architecture—you’ve noticed that by now, no doubt—we need to remind ourselves from time to time that architecture is not a goal unto itself, but only the means to an end. Building systems from the architecture is the end game, systems that have the qualities necessary to meet the concerns of their stakeholders.

虽然这是一本关于软件架构的书，但你已经注意到，毫无疑问，我们需要不时提醒自己，架构本身并不是一个目标，而只是达到目的的手段。从架构中构建系统是最终的游戏，系统必须具备满足其利益相关者关注的必要品质。

This chapter covers two critical areas in system-building—implementation and testing—from the point of view of architecture. What is the relationship of architecture to implementation (and vice versa)? What is the relationship of architecture to testing (and vice versa)?

本章从架构的角度介绍了系统构建、实现和测试的两个关键领域。架构与实现（反之亦然）的关系是什么？架构与测试（反之亦然）的关系是什么？

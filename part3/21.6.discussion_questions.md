21.6 Discussion Questions 问题讨论
===

1. Think of a software system that you’re working on. Prepare a 30-minute presentation on the business drivers for this system.
2. If you were going to evaluate the architecture for this system, who would you want to participate? What would be the stakeholder roles and who could you get to represent those roles?
3. Use the utility tree that you wrote for the ATM in Chapter 16 and the design that you sketched for the ATM in Chapter 17 to perform the scenario analysis step of the ATAM. Capture any risks and nonrisks that you discover. Better yet, perform the analysis on the design carried out by a colleague.
4. It is not uncommon for an organization to evaluate two competing architectures. How would you modify the ATAM to produce a quantitative output that facilitates this comparison?
5. Suppose you’ve been asked to evaluate the architecture for a system in confidence. The architect isn’t available. You aren’t allowed to discuss the evaluation with any of the system’s stakeholders. How would you proceed?
6. Under what circumstances would you want to employ a full-strength ATAM and under what circumstances would you want to employ a Lightweight Architecture Evaluation?

18.5 Combining Views
===

The basic principle of documenting an architecture as a set of separate views brings a divide-and-conquer advantage to the task of documentation, but if the views were irrevocably different, with no association with one another, nobody would be able to understand the system as a whole.

Because all views in an architecture are part of that same architecture and exist to achieve a common purpose, many of them have strong associations with each other. Managing how architectural structures are associated is an important part of the architect’s job, independent of whether any documentation of those structures exists.

Sometimes the most convenient way to show a strong association between two views is to collapse them into a single combined view, as dictated by step 2 of the three-step method just presented to choose the views. A combined view is a view that contains elements and relations that come from two or more other views. Combined views can be very useful as long as you do not try to overload them with too many mappings.

The easiest way to merge views is to create an overlay that combines the information that would otherwise have been in two separate views. This works well if the coupling between the two views is tight; that is, there are strong associations between elements in one view and elements in the other view. If that is the case, the structure described by the combined view will be easier to understand than the two views seen separately. For an example, see the overlay of decomposition and uses sketches shown in Figure 18.2. In an overlay, the elements and the relations keep the types as defined in their constituent views.

The views below often combine naturally:
* _Various C&C views_. Because C&C views all show runtime relations among
components and connectors of various types, they tend to combine well.
Different (separate) C&C views tend to show different parts of the system,
or tend to show decomposition refinements of components in other views.
The result is often a set of views that can be combined easily.

* _Deployment view with either SOA or communicating-processes views_. An SOA view shows services, and a communicating-processes view shows processes. In both cases, these are components that are deployed onto processors. Thus there is a strong association between the elements in these views.
* _Decomposition view and any of work assignment, implementation, uses, or layered views_. The decomposed modules form the units of work, development, and uses. In addition, these modules populate layers.

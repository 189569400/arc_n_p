For a more comprehensive treatment of the ATAM, see [Clements 01b].

Multiple case studies of applying the ATAM are available. They can be found by going to www.sei.cmu.edu/library and searching for “ATAM case study.”

To understand the historical roots of the ATAM, and to see a second (simpler) architecture evaluation method, you can read about the software architecture analysis method (SAAM) in [Kazman 94].

Maranzano et al. have published a paper dealing with a long tradition of architecture evaluation at AT&T and its successor companies [Maranzano 05].

If a system is important enough for you to explicitly design its architecture, then that architecture should be evaluated.

The number of evaluations and the extent of each evaluation may vary from project to project. A designer should perform an evaluation during the process of making an important decision. Lightweight evaluations can be performed several times during a project as a peer review exercise.

The ATAM is a comprehensive method for evaluating software architectures. It works by having project decision makers and stakeholders articulate a precise list of quality attribute requirements (in the form of scenarios) and by illuminating the architectural decisions relevant to carrying out each high-priority scenario. The decisions can then be understood in terms of risks or nonrisks to find any trouble spots in the architecture.

Lightweight Architecture Evaluation, based on the ATAM, provides an inexpensive, low-ceremony architecture evaluation that can be carried out in an afternoon.

21 Architecture Evaluation
===

_Fear cannot be banished, but it can be calm and without panic; it can be mitigated by reason and evaluation._  
—Vannevar Bush

We discussed analysis techniques in Chapter 14. Analysis lies at the heart of architecture evaluation, which is the process of determining if an architecture is fit for the purpose for which it is intended. Architecture is such an important contributor to the success of a system and software engineering project that it makes sense to pause and make sure that the architecture you’ve designed will be able to provide all that’s expected of it. That’s the role of evaluation. Fortunately there are mature methods to evaluate architectures that use many of the concepts and techniques you’ve already learned in previous chapters of this book.

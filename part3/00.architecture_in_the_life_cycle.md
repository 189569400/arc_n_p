第三部分 **生命周期中的架构**
===

Part I of this book introduced architecture and the various contextual lenses through which it could be viewed. To recap from Chapter 3, those contexts include the following:

本书的第一部分介绍了体系结构以及可以用来查看体系结构的各种上下文关系。 回顾第三章，这些上下文包括以下内容：

* *Technical*. What technical role does the software architecture play in the system or systems of which it’s a part? Part of the answer to this is what Part II of our book is about and the rest is included in Part IV. Part II describes how decisions are made, and Part IV describes the environment that determines whether the results of the decisions satisfy the needs of the organization.
* *技术*。 软件体系结构在组成其一部分的系统中起什么技术作用？ 答案的一部分是本书第二部分的内容，其余部分包含在第四部分中。 第二部分描述了如何制定决策，第四部分描述了确定决策结果是否满足组织需求的环境。
* *Project life cycle*. How does a software architecture relate to the other phases of a software development life cycle? The answer to this is what Part III of our book is about.
* *项目生命周期*。 软件体系结构与软件开发生命周期的其他阶段如何相关？ 答案就是这本书的第三部分。
* *Business*. How does the presence of a software architecture affect an organization’s business environment? The answer to this is what Part IV of our book is about.
* *业务*。 软件体系结构的存在如何影响组织的业务环境？ 答案就是这本书的第四部分。
* *Professional*. What is the role of a software architect in an organization or a development project? The answer to this is threaded throughout the entire book, but especially in Chapter 24, where we treat the duties, skills, and knowledge of software architects.
* *专业的*。 软件架构师在组织或开发项目中的作用是什么？ 答案贯穿于整本书，尤其是在第24章中，我们在该章中讨论了软件架构师的职责，技能和知识。

Part II concentrated on the technical context of software architecture. In our philosophy, this is tantamount to understanding quality attributes. If you have a deep understanding of how architecture affects quality attributes, then you have mastered most of what you need to know about making design decisions.

第二部分集中讨论软件体系结构的技术环境。 按照我们的理念，这等同于理解质量属性。 如果您对体系结构如何影响质量属性有深刻的了解，那么您已经掌握了制定设计决策所需的大部分知识。

Here in Part III we turn our attention to how to constructively apply that knowledge within the context of a particular software development project. Here is where software architecture meets software engineering: How do architecture concerns affect the gathering of requirements, the carrying out of design decisions, the validation and capturing of the design, and the transformation of design into implementation? In Part III, we’ll find out.

在第三部分中，我们将注意力转移到如何在特定软件开发项目的上下文中建设性地应用该知识。 这是软件体系结构与软件工程相遇的地方：体系结构问题如何影响需求的收集，设计决策的执行，设计的验证和捕获以及设计到实现的转换？ 在第三部分中，我们将找出答案。

# A Word about Methods 关于方法的话
Because this is a book about software architecture in practice, we’ve tried to spell out specific methods in enough detail so that you can emulate them. You’ll see PALM, a method for eliciting business goals that an architecture should accommodate. You’ll see Views and Beyond, an approach for documenting architecture in a set of views that serve stakeholders and their concerns. You’ll see ATAM, a method for evaluating an architecture against stakeholders’ ideas of what quality attributes it should provide. You’ll see CBAM, a method for assessing which evolutionary path of an architecture will best serve stakeholders’ needs.

由于这是一本有关实践中的软件架构的书，因此我们尝试了足够详细地阐明特定方法，以便您可以模拟它们。 您将看到PALM，这是一种用于实现架构应适应的业务目标的方法。 您将看到Views and Beyond，这是一种以一系列视图记录文档架构的方法，可为利益相关者及其关注的问题提供服务。 您将看到ATAM，这是一种根据利益相关者对架构应提供的质量属性的想法评估架构的方法。 您会看到CBAM，这是一种评估架构的演化路径最能满足利益相关者需求的方法。

All of these methods rely in some way or another on tapping stakeholders’ knowledge about what an architecture under development should provide. As presented in their respective chapters, each of these methods includes a similar process of identifying the relevant stakeholders, putting them in a room together, presenting a briefing about the method that the stakeholders have been assembled to participate in, and then launching into the method.

所有这些方法都以某种方式依赖于挖掘利益相关者对正在开发的架构应提供的内容的知识。 如在其各自的章节中所述，每种方法都包括一个类似的过程，该过程用于识别相关的利益相关者，将他们放到一个房间中，简要介绍有关利益相关者已经参与的方法，然后启动该方法。

So why is it necessary to put all of the stakeholders in the same room? The short answer is that it isn’t. There are (at least) three major engagement models for conducting an architecture-focused method. Why three? Because we have identified two important factors, each of which has two values, that describe four potential engagement models for gathering information from stakeholders. These two factors are

那么，为什么有必要将所有利益相关者放在同一个房间里？ 简短的答案是，不是。 至少有三个主要的参与模型可用于执行以体系结构为中心的方法。 为什么是三个？ 因为我们已经确定了两个重要因素，每个因素都有两个值，它们描述了四种潜在的参与模型，用于从利益相关者那里收集信息。 这两个因素是

1. Location (co-located or distributed)  
1.位置（同位或分布式）  
2. Synchronicity (synchronous or asynchronous)  
2.同步性（同步或异步）

One option (co-located and asynchronous) makes no sense, and so we are left with three viable engagement models. The advantages and disadvantages we’ve observed of each engagement model follow.

一种选择（并置和异步）没有任何意义，因此我们剩下三种可行的参与模型。 我们观察到了每种参与模式的优缺点。

Why has the big-meeting format (co-located, synchronous) tended to prevail? There are several reasons:

为什么大会议格式（并置，同步）倾向于盛行？ 有以下几个原因：

* It compresses the time required for the method. Time on site for remote participants is minimized, although as we will see, travel time is not considered in this argument. All of the stakeholders are available with minimal external distractions.
* 压缩该方法所需的时间。 远程参与者在现场的时间已减至最少，尽管正如我们将看到的，在此论点中未考虑旅行时间。 所有利益相关者都可以在外部干扰最小的情况下使用。
* It emphasizes the importance of the method. Any meeting important enough to bring multiple people together for an extended time must be judged by management to be important.
* 强调方法的重要性。 管理层必须认为任何重要的会议都足以使多人长时间聚会。
* It benefits from the helpful group mentality that emerges when people are in the same room working toward a common goal. The group mentality fosters buy-in to the architecture and buy-in to the reasons it exists. Putting stakeholders in the same room lets them open communication paths with the architect and with each other, paths that will often remain open long after the meeting has run its course. We always enjoy seeing business cards exchanged with handshakes when stakeholders meet each other for the first time. Putting the architect in a room full of stakeholders for a couple of days is a very healthy thing for any project.
* 当人们在同一个房间里朝着共同目标努力时，就会产生有益的团体心态。 团队的心态促进了对架构的认同和对架构存在的理由的认同。 将利益相关者放在同一个房间中，可以使他们与架构师以及彼此之间打开沟通路径，而这些路径通常会在会议进行之后很长时间才保持开放。 当利益相关者第一次见面时，我们总是很高兴看到名片被握手交换。 对于任何项目来说，将架构师放在一个充满利益相关者的房间中几天是一件很健康的事情。

Model | Advantages | Disadvantages
--|--|--
All stakeholders in the same room for the duration of the exercise (co-located and synchronous). | All stakeholders participate equally. Group mentality produces buy-in for architecture and the results of the exercise. Enduring communication paths are opened among stakeholders. This option takes the shortest calendar time. | Scheduling can be problematic. Some stakeholders might not be forthcoming in a crowd. Stakeholders might incur substantial travel costs to attend.
Some stakeholders participate in exercise remotely (distributed and synchronous). | Saves travel costs for remote participants; this option might permit participation by stakeholders who otherwise would not be able to contribute. | Technology is a limiting factor; remote participants almost always are secondclass citizens in terms of their participation and afterexercise “connection” to other participants.
Facilitators interviewing stakeholders individually or in small groups (distributed and asynchronous). | Allows for in-depth interaction between facilitators and stakeholders. Eliminates group factors that might inhibit a stakeholder from speaking in public. | If stakeholders are widely distributed, increased travel costs incurred by facilitator(s). Reduced group buy-in. Reduced group mentality. Reduced after-exercise communication among stakeholders. Exercise stretched out over a longer period of calendar time.

模型 | 优势| 缺点
--|--|--
整个练习期间，所有利益相关者都在同一个房间中（同位并同步）。 | 所有利益相关者平等参与。 团队的心态会为架构和练习的结果带来支持。 利益相关者之间建立了持久的沟通途径。 此选项花费最短的日历时间。 | 调度可能会出现问题。 一些利益相关者可能不会聚集在一起。 利益相关者参加会议可能会产生大量旅行费用。
一些利益相关者可以远程（分布式和同步）参与锻炼。 | 为远程参与者节省差旅费用； 此选项可能允许利益相关者参与，否则他们将无法做出贡献。 | 技术是一个限制因素； 就其参与和运动后与其他参与者的“联系”而言，远程参与者几乎总是二等公民。
主持人分别或以小组形式（分布式和异步）采访利益相关者。 | 允许协调人和利益相关者之间的深入互动。 消除了可能阻碍利益相关者在公共场合发言的群体因素。 | 如果利益相关者分布广泛，主持人将增加旅行费用。 减少团体买入。 团体心态降低。 减少利益相关者之间的运动后沟通。 锻炼可以延长日历时间。

But there are, as ever, tradeoffs. The big-meeting format can be costly and difficult to fit into an already crowded project schedule. Often the hardest aspect of executing any of our methods is finding two contiguous days when all the important stakeholders are available. Also, the travel costs associated with a big meeting can be substantial in a distributed organization. And some stakeholders might not be as forthcoming as we would like if they are in a room surrounded by strong-willed peers or higher-ups (although our methods use facilitation techniques to try to correct for this).

但是，仍然存在权衡取舍。 大会议形式可能成本高昂，并且难以适应已经很拥挤的项目进度。 通常，执行我们任何一种方法的最困难方面是找到两个重要的利益相关者都可以使用的连续日子。 同样，在分布式组织中，与大型会议相关的差旅费用可能很高。 而且，如果某些利益相关者在一个有强烈意愿的同伴或上流社会人士包围的房间里，他们可能不会像我们想要的那样积极主动（尽管我们的方法使用促进技术来对此进行纠正）。

So which model is best? You already know the answer: It depends. You can see the tradeoffs among the different approaches. Pick the one that does the best job for your organization and its particularities.

那么哪种模式最好呢？ 您已经知道答案：这取决于。 您可以看到不同方法之间的权衡。 选择最适合您的组织及其特殊性的人。

# Conclusion 结论
As you read Part III and learn about architecture methods, remember that the form of the method we present is the one in which the most practical experience resides. But:

当您阅读第三部分并了解体系结构方法时，请记住，我们介绍的方法的形式是最实际的经验所在。 但：

1. You can always adjust the engagement model to be something other than everybody-in-the-same-room if that will work better for you.  
1.您可以始终将参与度模型调整为与其他人不在同一房间，如果这样对您更有效。  
2. Whereas the steps of a method are nominally carried out in sequential order according to a set agenda, sometimes there must be dynamic modifications to the schedule to accommodate personnel availability or architectural information. Every situation is unique, and there may be times when you need to return briefly to an earlier step, jump forward to a later step, or iterate among steps, as the need dictates.  
2.尽管方法的步骤通常是按照设定的议程按顺序执行的，但有时必须对时间表进行动态修改以适应人员的可用性或体系结构信息。 每种情况都是独特的，有时您可能需要根据需要指示短暂返回到较早的步骤，跳到较晚的步骤或在各个步骤之间进行迭代。

P.S.: We do provide one example of a shortened version of one of our methods —the ATAM. We call this Lightweight Architecture Evaluation, and it is described in Chapter 21.

附注：我们确实提供了一种方法的简化版本的一个示例-ATAM。 我们将其称为“轻量级体系结构评估”，将在第21章中进行介绍。

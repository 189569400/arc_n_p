The view of design as the process of making decisions dates to the 1940s [Mettler 91], but it has been recently applied to ar-chitecture design most prominently by Philippe Kruchten [Kruchten 04], and Hans van Vliet and Jan Bosch [van Vliet 05].

The Software Engineering Institute has produced a number of reports de-scribing the ADD method and its application in a variety of contexts. These in-clude [Wojcik 06], [Kazman 04], and [Wood 07].

George Fairbanks has written an engaging book that describes a risk-driven process of architecture design, entitled Just Enough Software Architecture: A Risk-Driven Approach [Fairbanks 10].

Tony Lattanze has created an Architecture-Centric Design Method (ACDM), described in his book Architecting Software Intensive Systems: A Practitioners Guide [Lattanze 08].

Ian Gorton’s Essential Architecture, Second Edition, emphasizes the middle-ware aspects of a design [Gorton 10].

1. How would you employ the Agile practices of pair programming, frequent team interaction, and dedicated customer involvement in a distributed de-velopment environment?
2. Suppose, as a supporter of architecture practices, you were asked to write an Architecture Manifesto that was modeled on the Agile Manifesto. What would it look like?
3. Agile projects must be budgeted and scheduled like any other. How would you do that? Does an architecture help or hinder this process?
4. What do you think are the essential skills for an architect operating in an Agile context? How do you suppose they differ for an architect working in a non-Agile project?
5. The Agile Manifesto professes to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Rationalize this statement in terms of the role of tools in the modern software development process: compilers, integrated devel-opment environments, debuggers, configuration managers, automatic test tools, and build and configuration tools.
6. Critique the Agile Manifesto in the context of a 200-developer, 5-mil-lion-line project with an expected lifetime of 20 years.

1. What are the reasons that top-down and bottom-up schedule estimates dif-fer and how would you resolve this conflict in practice?
2. Generic project management practices advocate creating a work breakdown structure as the first artifact produced by a project. What is wrong with this practice from an architectural perspective?
3. If you were managing a globally distributed team, what architectural documentation artifacts would you want to create first?
4. If you were managing a globally distributed team, what aspects of project management would have to change to account for cultural differences?
5. Enumerate three different global metrics and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each?
6. How could you use architectural evaluation as a portion of a governance plan?
7. In Chapter 1 we described a work assignment structure for software architecture, which can be documented as a work assignment view. (Because it maps software elements—modules—to a nonsoftware environmental structure—the organizational units that will be responsible for implementing the modules—it is a kind of allocation view.) Discuss how documenting a work assignment view for your architecture provides a vehicle for software architects and managers to work together to staff a project. Where is the dividing line between the part of the work assignment view that the architect should provide and the part that the manager should provide?

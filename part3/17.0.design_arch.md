17 Designing an Architecture
===

_In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer. It’s interior decorating. It’s the fabric of the curtains or the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the
meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service._  
—Steve Jobs

We have discussed the building blocks for designing a software architecture, which principally are locating architecturally significant requirements; capturing quality attribute requirements; and choosing, generating, tailoring, and analyzing design decisions for achieving those requirements. All that’s missing is a way to pull the pieces together. The purpose of this chapter is to provide that way.

We begin by describing our strategy for designing an architecture and then present a packaging of these ideas into a method: the Attribute-Driven Design method.

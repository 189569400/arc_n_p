22.2 Organizing 组织
===

Some of the elements of organizing a project are team organization, division of responsibilities between project manager and software architect, and planning for global or distributed development.

# Software development team Organization

Once the architecture design is in place, it can be used to define the project organization. Each member of the team that designed the software architecture becomes the lead for a team whose responsibility is to implement a portion of the architecture. Thus, responsibility for fleshing out and implementing the design is distributed to those who had a role in its definition.

In addition, many support functions such as writing user documentation, system testing, training, integration, quality assurance, and configuration management are done in a “matrix” form. That is, individuals who are “matrixed” report to one person—a functional manager—for their tasking and professional advancement and to another individual (or to several individuals)—project managers—for their project responsibilities. Matrix organizations have the advantage of being able to allocate and balance resources as needed rather than assign them permanently to a project that may have sporadic needs for individuals with particular skills. They have the disadvantage that the people in them tend to work on several projects simultaneously. This can cause problems such as divided loyalties or competition among projects for resources.

Typical roles within a software development team are the following:

* _Team leader_—manages tasks within the team.
* _Developer_—designs and implements subsystem code.
* _Configuration manager_—performs regular builds and integration tests. This role can frequently be shared among multiple software development teams.
* _System test manager_—system test and acceptance testing.
* _Product manager_—represents marketing; defines feature sets and how system being developed integrates with other systems in a product suite.

# Division of Responsibilities between Project Manager and Software Architect

One of the important relations within a team is between the software architect and the project manager. You can view the project manager as responsible for the external-facing aspects of the project and the software architect as responsible for the internal aspects of the project. This division will only work if the external view accurately reflects the internal situation and the internal activities accurately reflect the expectations of the external stakeholders. That is, the project manager should know, and reflect to management, the progress and the risks within the project, and the software architect should know, and reflect to developers, stakeholder concerns. The relationship between the project manager and the software architect will have a large impact on the success of a project. They need to have a good working relation and be mindful of the roles they are filling and the boundaries of those roles.

We use the knowledge areas for project management taken from the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) to show the duties of these two roles in a variety of categories. Table 22.1 (on the next page) gives the knowledge area in the language of the PMBOK, defines the knowledge area in English, what that means in software terms, and how the project manager and the software architect collaborate to satisfy that category.

Observe in this table that the project manager is responsible for the business side of the project—providing resources, creating and managing the budget and schedule, negotiating with marketing, ensuring quality—and the software architect is responsible for the technical side of the project—achieving quality, determining measures to be used, reviewing requirements for feasibility, generating develop-time requirements, and leading the development team.

Global Development

Most substantial projects today are developed by distributed teams. In many organizations these teams are globally distributed. Some reasons for this trend are the following:
* _Cost_. Labor costs vary depending on location, and there is a perception that moving some development to a low-cost venue will decrease the overall cost of the project. Experience has shown that, at least for software development, savings may only be reaped in the long term. Until the developers in the low-cost venue have a sufficient level of domain expertise and until the management practices are adapted to compensate for the difficulties of distributed development, a large amount of rework must be done, thereby cutting into and perhaps overwhelming any savings from wages.
* _Skill sets and labor availability_. Organizations may not be able to hire developers at a single location: relocation costs are high, the size of the developer pool may be small, or the skill sets needed are specialized and unavailable in a single location. Developing a system in a distributed fashion allows for the work to move to where the workers are rather than forcing the workers to move to the work location.
* _Local knowledge of markets_. Developers who are developing variants of a system to be sold in their market have more knowledge about the types of features that are assumed and the types of cultural issues that may arise.

A consequence of performing global or distributed development is that architecture and allocation of responsibilities to teams is more important than in co-located development, where all of the developers are in a single office, or at least in close proximity. For example, assume Module A uses an interface from Module B. In time, as circumstances change, this interface may need to be modified. This means the team responsible for Module B must coordinate with the team responsible for Module A, as indicated in Figure 22.2.

Methods for coordination include the following:

* _Informal contacts_. Informal contacts, such as meeting at the coffee room or in the hallway, are only possible if the teams are co-located.
* _Documentation_. Documentation, if it is well written, well organized, and properly disseminated, can be used as a means to coordinate the teams, whether co-located or at a distance.
* _Meetings_. Teams can hold meetings, either scheduled or ad hoc and either face to face or remote, to help bring the team together and raise awareness of issues.
* _Electronic communication_. Various forms of electronic communication can be used as a coordination mechanism, such as email, news groups, blogs, and wikis.

The choice of method depends on many factors, including infrastructure available, corporate culture, language skills, time zones involved, and the number of teams dependent on a particular module. Until an organization has established a working method for coordinating among distributed teams, misunderstandings among the teams are going to cause delays and, in some cases, serious defects in a project.

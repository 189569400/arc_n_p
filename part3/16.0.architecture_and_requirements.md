16 架构和需求 Architecture and Requirements
===

_The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right lace at the right time, and second, doing something about it._  
_取得重大成功的两个最重要的要求是：第一，在正确的时间处于正确的位置，第二，为此做点什么。_

—Ray Kroc

Architectures exist to build systems that satisfy requirements. That’s obvious. What may be less obvious is that, to an architect, not all requirements are created equal. Some have a much more profound effect on the architecture than others. An architecturally significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that will have a profound effect on the architecture—that is, the architecture might well be dramatically different in the absence of such a requirement.

架构的存在是为了构建满足需求的系统。这是显而易见的。可能不太明显的是，对于架构师来说，并不是所有的需求都是平等的。有些对架构的影响比其他的深刻得多。架构重要需求（ASR）是一种对架构有深远影响的需求，也就是说，如果没有这种需求，架构可能会有很大的不同。

You cannot hope to design a successful architecture if you do not know the ASRs. ASRs often, but not always, take the form of quality attribute requirements—the performance, security, modifiability, availability, usability, and so forth, that the architecture must provide to the system. In Chapters 5–13 we introduced patterns and tactics to achieve quality attributes. Each time you select a pattern or tactic to use in your architecture, you are changing the architecture as a result of the need to meet quality attribute requirements. The more difficult and important the QA requirement, the more likely it is to significantly affect the architecture, and hence to be an ASR.

如果你不了解ASR，你就不能指望设计出一个成功的架构。ASR通常（但并非总是）采取质量属性需求的形式，即架构必须向系统提供的性能、安全性、可修改性、可用性、可用性等。在第5-13章中，我们介绍了实现质量属性的模式和策略。每次您选择要在架构中使用的模式或策略时，您都会因为需要满足质量属性需求而更改架构。QA需求越困难、越重要，就越有可能对架构产生重大影响，从而成为ASR。

Architects have to identify ASRs, usually after doing a significant bit of work to uncover candidate ASRs. Competent architects know this, and as we observe experienced architects going about their duties, we notice that the first thing they do is start talking to the important stakeholders. They’re gathering the information they need to produce the architecture that will respond to the project’s needs—whether or not this information has already been identified.

架构师必须识别ASR，通常是在做了大量工作来发现候选ASR之后。有能力的架构师知道这一点，当我们观察到经验丰富的架构师履行职责时，我们注意到他们做的第一件事就是开始与重要的利益相关者交谈。他们正在收集所需的信息，以生成能够响应项目需求的架构，无论这些信息是否已被识别。

This chapter provides some systematic means for identifying the ASRs and other factors that will shape the architecture.

本章提供了一些系统化的方法，用于识别ASR和其他影响架构的因素。

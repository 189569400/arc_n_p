16.3 Gathering ASRs by Understanding the Business Goals 通过了解业务目标来收集ASR
===

Business goals are the raison d’être for building a system. No organization builds a system without a reason; rather, the organization’s leaders want to further the mission and ambitions of their organization and themselves. Common business goals include making a profit, of course, but most organizations have many more concerns than simply profit, and in other organizations (e.g., nonprofits, charities, governments), profit is the farthest thing from anyone’s mind.

Business goals are of interest to architects because they often are the precursor or progenitor of requirements that may or may not be captured in a requirements specification but whose achievement (or lack) signals a successful (or less than suc-cessful) architectural design. Business goals frequently lead directly to ASRs.

There are three possible relationships between business goals and an architecture:

1. _Business goals often lead to quality attribute requirements._ Or to put it another way, every quality attribute requirement—such as user-visible response time or platform flexibility or ironclad security or any of a dozen other needs—should originate from some higher purpose that can be described in terms of added value. If we ask, for example, “Why do you want this system to have a really fast response time?”, we might hear that this will differentiate the product from its competition and let the developing organization capture market share; or that this will make the soldier a more effective warfighter, which is the mission of the acquiring organization; or other reasons having to do with the satisfaction of some business goal.

2. _Business goals may directly affect the architecture without precipitating a quality attribute requirement at all._ In Chapter 3 we told the story of the architect who designed a system without a database until the manager informed him that the database team needed work. The architecture was importantly affected without any relevant quality attribute requirement.

FIGURE 16.1 Some business goals may lead to quality attribute requirements (which lead to architectures), or lead directly to architectural decisions, or lead to nonarchitectural solutions.

3. _No influence at all._ Not all business goals lead to quality attributes. For example, a business goal to “reduce cost” may be realized by lowering the facility’s thermostats in the winter or reducing employees’ salaries or pensions.

Figure 16.1 illustrates the major points just described. In the figure, the ar-rows mean “leads to.” The solid arrows are the ones highlighting relationships of most interest to architects.

Architects often become aware of an organization’s business and business goals via osmosis—working, listening, talking, and soaking up the goals that are at work in an organization. Osmosis is not without its benefits, but more system-atic ways are possible. We describe one such way in the sidebar “A Method for Capturing Business Goals.”

A Categorization of Business Goals

Business goals are worth capturing explicitly. This is because they often imply ASRs that would otherwise go undetected until it is too late or too expensive to address them. Capturing business goals is well served by having a set of candi-date business goals handy to use as conversation starters. If you know that many businesses want to gain market share, for instance, you can use that to engage the right stakeholders in your organization to ask, “What are our ambitions about market share for this product, and how could the architecture contribute to meet-ing them?”

Our research in business goals has led us to adopt the categories shown in Table 16.2. These categories can be used as an aid to brainstorming and elici-tation. By employing the list of categories, and asking the stakeholders about possible business goals in each category, some assurance of coverage is gained.

TABLE 16.2 A List of Standard Business Goal Categories

 - | -
---|---
1. | Contributing to the growth and continuity of the organization
2. | Meeting financial objectives
3. | Meeting personal objectives
4. | Meeting responsibility to employees
5. | Meeting responsibility to society
6. | Meeting responsibility to state
7. | Meeting responsibility to shareholders
8. | Managing market position
9. | Improving business processes
10. | Managing the quality and reputation of products
11. | Managing change in environmental factors

These categories are not completely orthogonal. Some business goals may
fit into more than one category, and that’s all right. In an elicitation method, the
categories should prompt questions about the existence of organizational busi-
ness goals that fall into that category. If the categories overlap, then this might
cause us to ask redundant questions. This is not harmful and could well be help-
ful. The utility of these categories is to help identify all business goals, not to
provide a taxonomy.

1. _Contributing to the growth and continuity of the organization._ How does the system being developed contribute to the growth and continuity of the organization? In one experience using this business goal category, the system being developed was the sole reason for the existence of the organization. If the system was not successful, the organization would cease to exist. Other topics that might come up in this category deal with market share, product lines, and international sales.

2. _Meeting financial objectives._ This category includes revenue generated or saved by the system. The system may be for sale, either in standalone form or by providing a service, in which case it generates revenue. The system may be for use in an internal process, in which case it should make those processes more effective or more efficient. Also in this category is the cost of development, deployment, and operation of the system. But this category can also include financial objectives of individuals: a manager hoping for a raise, for example, or a shareholder expecting a dividend.

3. _Meeting personal objectives._ Individuals have various goals associated with the construction of a system. They may range from “I want to enhance my reputation by the success of this system” to “I want to learn new technol-ogies” to “I want to gain experience with a different portion of the devel-opment process than in the past.” In any case, it is possible that technical decisions are influenced by personal objectives.

4. _Meeting responsibility to employees._ In this category, the employees in question are usually those employees involved in development or those involved in operation. Responsibility to employees involved in develop-ment might include ensuring that certain types of employees have a role in the development of this system, or it might include providing employ-ees the opportunities to learn new skills. Responsibility to employees involved in operating the system might include safety, workload, or skill considerations.

5. _Meeting responsibility to society._ Some organizations see themselves as being in business to serve society. For these organizations, the system under development is helping them meet those responsibilities. But all organiza-tions must discharge a responsibility to society by obeying relevant laws and regulations. Other topics that might come up under this category are resource usage, “green computing,” ethics, safety, open source issues, secu-rity, and privacy.

6. _Meeting responsibility to state._ Government systems, almost by definition, are intended to meet responsibility to a state or country. Other topics that might come up in this category deal with export controls, regulatory confor-mance, or supporting government initiatives.

7. _Meeting responsibility to shareholders._ There is overlap between this cate-gory and the financial objectives category, but additional topics that might come up here are liability protection and certain types of regulatory confor-mance such as, in the United States, adherence to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

8. _Managing market position._ Topics that might come up in this category are the strategy used to increase or hold market share, various types of intellec-tual property protection, or the time to market.

9. _Improving business processes._ Although this category partially overlaps with meeting financial objectives, reasons other than cost reduction exist for improving business processes. It may be that improved business processes enable new markets, new products, or better customer support.

10. _Managing the quality and reputation of products._ Topics that might come up in this category include branding, recalls, types of potential users, quali-ty of existing products, and testing support and strategies.

11. _Managing change in environmental factors._ As we said in Chapter 3, the business context for a system might change. This item is intended to en-courage the stakeholders to consider what might change in the business goals for a system.

**Expressing Business Goals**

How will you write down a business goal once you’ve learned it? Just as for quality attributes, a scenario makes a convenient, uniform, and clarifying way to express business goals. It helps ensure that all business goals are expressed clearly, in a consistent fashion, and contain sufficient information to enable their shared understanding by relevant stakeholders. Just as a quality attribute scenario adds precision and meaning to an otherwise vague need for, say, “modifiability,” a business goal scenario will add precision and meaning to a desire to “meet fi-nancial objectives.”

Our business goal scenario template has seven parts. They all relate to the system under development, the identity of which is implicit. The parts are these:

1. _Goal-source_. These are the people or written artifacts providing the goal.

2. _Goal-subject_. These are the stakeholders who own the goal and wish it to be true. Each stakeholder might be an individual or (in the case of a goal that has no one owner and has been assimilated into an organization) the or-ganization itself. If the business goal is, for example, “Maximize dividends for the shareholders,” who is it that cares about that? It is probably not the programmers or the system’s end users (unless they happen to own stock). Goal-subjects can and do belong to different organizations. The developing organization, the customer organizations, subcontractors, vendors and sup-pliers, standards bodies, regulatory agencies, and organizations responsible for systems with which ours must interact are all potential goal-subjects.

3. _Goal-object_. These are the entities to which the goal applies. “Object” is used in the sense of the object of a verb in a sentence. All goals have goal-objects: we want something to be true about something (or someone) that (or whom) we care about. For example, for goals we would character-ize as furthering one’s self-interest, the goal-object can be “myself or my family.” For some goals the goal-object is clearly the development orga-nization, but for some goals the goal-object can be more refined, such as the rank-and-file employees of the organization or the shareholders of the organization. Table 16.3 is a representative cross-section of goal-objects. Goal-objects in the table start small, where the goal-object is a single indi-vidual, and incrementally grow until the goal-object is society at large.

4. _Environment_. This is the context for this goal. For example, there are social, legal, competitive, customer, and technological environments. Sometimes the political environment is key; this is as a kind of social factor. Upcoming technology may be a major factor.

5. _Goal_. This is any business goal articulated by the goal-source.

6. _Goal-measure_. This is a testable measurement to determine how one would know if the goal has been achieved. The goal-measure should usually include a time component, stating the time by which the goal should be achieved.

7. _Pedigree and value_. The pedigree of the goal tells us the degree of confidence the person who stated the goal has in it, and the goal’s volatility and value. The value of a goal can be expressed by how much its owner is willing to spend to achieve it or its relative importance compared to other goals. Relative importance may be given by a ranking from 1 (most important) to n (least important), or by assigning each goal a value on a fixed scale such as 1 to 10 or high-medium-low. We combine value and pedigree into one part although it certainly is possible to treat them separately. The important concern is that both are captured.

Elements 2–6 can be combined into a sentence that reads:

For the system being developed, \<goal-subject\> desires that \<goal-object\> achieve \<goal\> in the context of \<environment\> and will be satisfied if \<goal-measure\>.

The sentence can be augmented by the goal’s source (element 1) and the goal’s pedigree and value (element 7). Some sample business goal scenarios in-clude the following:

* For MySys, the project manager has the goal that his family’s stock in the company will rise by 5 percent (as a result of the success of MySys).
* For MySys, the developing organization’s CEO has the goal that MySys will make it 50 percent less likely that his nation will be attacked.
* For MySys, the portfolio manager has the goal that MySys will make the portfolio 30 percent more profitable.
* For MySys, the project manager has the goal that customer satisfaction will rise by 10 percent (as a result of the increased quality of MySys).

In many contexts, the goals of different stakeholders may conflict. By iden-tifying the stakeholder who owns the goal, the sources of conflicting goals can be identified.

**A General Scenario for Business Goals**

A general scenario (see Chapter 4) is a template for constructing specific or “con-crete” scenarios. It uses the generic structure of a scenario to supply a list of possible values for each non-boilerplate part of a scenario. See Table 16.4 for a general scenario for business goals.

For each of these scenarios you might want to additionally capture its source (e.g., Did this come directly from the goal-subject, a document, a third party, a legal requirement?), its volatility, and its importance.

TABLE 16.3 Business Goals and Their Goal-Objects

Goal-Object | Business Goals That Often Have This Goal-Object | Remarks
---|---|---
Individual | Personal wealth, power, honor/face/reputation, game and gambling spirit, maintain or improve reputation (personal), family interests | The individual who has these goals has them for him/herself or his/her family.
System | Manage flexibility, distributed development, portability, open systems/standards, testability, product lines, integrability, interoperability, ease of installation and ease of repair, flexibility/configurability, performance, reliability/availability, ease of use, security, safety, scalability/extendibility, functionality, system constraints, internationalization, reduce time to market | These can be goals for a system being developed or acquired. The list applies to systems in general, but the quantification of any one item likely applies to a single system being developed or acquired.
Portfolio | Reduce cost of development, cost leadership, differentiation, reduce cost of retirement, smooth transition to follow-on systems, replace legacy systems, replace labor with automation, diversify operational sequence, eliminate intermediate stages, automate tracking of business events, collect/communicate/retrieve operational knowledge, improve decision making, coordinate across distance, align task and process, manage on basis of process measurements, operate effectively within the competitive environment, the technological environment, or the customer environment <br>Create something new, provide the best quality products and services possible, be the leading innovator in the industry | These goals live on the cusp between an individual system and the entire organization. They apply either to a single system or to an organization’s entire portfolio that the organization is building or acquiring to achieve its goals.
Organization’s Employees | Provide high rewards and benefits to employees, create a pleasant and friendly workplace, have satisfied employees, fulfill responsibility toward employees, maintain jobs of workforce on legacy systems | Before we get to the organization as a whole, there are some goals aimed at specific subsets of the organization.
Organization’s Shareholders | Maximize dividends for the shareholders | 
Organization | Growth of the business, continuity of the business, maximize profits over the short run, maximize profits over the long run, survival of the organization, maximize the company’s net assets and reserves, be a market leader, maximize the market share, expand or retain market share, enter new markets, maximize the company’s rate of growth, keep tax payments to a minimum, increase sales growth, maintain or improve reputation, achieve business goals through financial objectives, run a stable organization | These are goals for the organization as a whole. The organization can be a development or acquisition organization, although most were undoubtedly created with the former in mind.
Nation | Patriotism, national pride, national security, national welfare | Before we get to society at large, this goal-object is specifically limited to the goal owner’s own country.
Society | Run an ethical organization, responsibility toward society, be a socially responsible company, be of service to the community, operate effectively within social environment, operate effectively within legal environment | Some interpret “society” as “my society,” which puts this category closer to the nation goal-object, but we are taking a broader view.

**Capturing Business Goals**

Business goals are worth capturing because they can hold the key to discovering ASRs that emerge in no other context. One method for eliciting and documenting business goals is the Pedigreed Attribute eLicitation Method, or PALM. The word “pedigree” means that the business goal has a clear derivation or background. PALM uses the standard list of business goals and the business goal scenario format we described earlier.

PALM can be used to sniff out missing requirements early in the life cycle. For example, having stakeholders subscribe to the business goal of improving the quality and reputation of their products may very well lead to (for example) security, availability, and performance requirements that otherwise might not have been considered.

PALM can also be used to discover and carry along additional information about existing requirements. For example, a business goal might be to produce a product that outcompetes a rival’s market entry. This might precipitate a performance requirement for, say, half-second turnaround when the rival features one-second turnaround. But if the competitor releases a new product with half-second turnaround, then what does our requirement become? A conventional requirements document will continue to carry the half-second requirement, but the goal-savvy architect will know that the real requirement is to beat the competitor, which may mean even faster performance is needed.

Finally, PALM can be used to examine particularly difficult quality attribute requirements to see if they can be relaxed. We know of more than one system where a quality attribute requirement proved quite expensive to provide, and only after great effort, money, and time were expended trying to meet it was it revealed that the requirement had no actual basis other than being someone’s best guess or fond wish at the time.

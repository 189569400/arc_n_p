17.6 Discussion Questions 问题讨论

1. ADD does not help with the detailed design of interfaces for the architectural elements it identifies. Details of an interface include what each method does, whether you need to call a single all-encompassing method to perform the work of the element or many methods of finer-grained function, what exceptions are raised on the interface, and more. What are some examples where the specific design of an interface might bring more or less performance, security, or availability to a system? (By the way, if there are quality attribute implications to an interface, you can capture those as annotations on the element.)
2. What sets a constraint apart from other (even high-priority) requirements is that it is not negotiable. Should this consideration guide the design process? For example, would it be wise to design to satisfy all of the constraints be-fore worrying about other ASRs?
3. In discussion question 4 of Chapter 16 you were asked to create a utility tree for an ATM. Now choose the two most important ASRs from that util-ity tree and create a design fragment using the ADD method employing and instantiating a pattern.

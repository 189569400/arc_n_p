Architectures are driven by architecturally significant requirements: requirements that will have profound effects on the architecture. Architecturally significant requirements may be captured from requirements documents, by interviewing stakeholders, or by conducting a Quality Attribute Workshop.

In gathering these requirements, we should be mindful of the business goals of the organization. Business goals can be expressed in a common, structured form and represented as scenarios. Business goals may be elicited and docu-mented using a structured facilitation method called PALM.

A useful representation of quality attribute requirements is in a utility tree. The utility tree helps to capture these requirements in a structured form, starting from coarse, abstract notions of quality attributes and gradually refining them to the point where they are captured as scenarios. These scenarios are then priori-tized, and this prioritized set defines your “marching orders” as an architect.

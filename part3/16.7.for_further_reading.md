PALM can be used to capture the business goals that conform to a business goal viewpoint; that is, you can use PALM to populate a business goal view of your system, using the terminology of ISO Standard 42010. We discuss this in The Business Goals Viewpoint [Clements 10c]. Complete details of PALM can be found in CMU/SEI-2010-TN-018, Relating Business Goals to Architecturally Significant Requirements for Software Systems [Clements 10b].

The Open Group Architecture Framework, available at www.opengroup.org/togaf/, provides a very complete template for documenting a business scenario that contains a wealth of useful information. Although we believe architects can make use of a lighter-weight means to capture a business goal, it’s worth a look.

The definitive reference source for the Quality Attribute Workshop is [Bar-bacci 03].

The term architecturally significant requirement was created by the Soft-ware Architecture Review and Assessment (SARA) group [Obbink 02].

When dealing with systems of systems (SoS), the interaction and handoff between the systems can be a source of problems. The Mission Thread Workshop and Business Thread Workshop focus on a single thread of activity within the overall SoS context and identify potential problems having to do with the inter-action of the disparate systems. Descriptions of these workshops can be found at [Klein 10] and [Gagliardi 09].

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has developed two reconstruction workbenches: Dali and Armin. Dali was our first attempt at creating a workbench for architecture recovery and conformance [Kazman 99]. Armin, a complete rewrite and rethink of Dali, is described in [O’Brien 03].

Both Armin and Dali were primarily focused on module structures of an architecture. A later tool, called DiscoTect, was aimed at discovering C&C structures. This is described in [Schmerl 06].

Many other architecture reverse-engineering tools have been created. A few of the notable ones created in academia are [van Deursen 04], [Murphy 01], and [Storey 97].

In addition there are a number of commercial architecture extraction and reconstruction tools that have been slowly gaining market acceptance in the past decade. Among these are the following:
* SonarJ (www.hello2morrow.com)
* Lattix (www.lattix.com)
* Understand (www.scitools.com)

Cai et al. [Cai 2011] compellingly demonstrate the need for architecture conformance testing in an experimental study that they conducted, wherein they found that software engineering students, given UML designs for a variety of relatively simple systems, violate those designs over 70 percent of the time.

Finally, the set of guidelines presented in this chapter for how to go about reconstructing an architecture was excerpted from [Kazman 02].

Writing architectural documentation is much like other types of writing. You must understand the uses to which the writing is to be put and the audience for the writing. Architectural documentation serves as a means for communication among various stakeholders, not only up the management chain and down to the developers but also across to peers.

An architecture is a complicated artifact, best expressed by focusing on particular perspectives depending on the message to be communicated. These perspectives are called views, and you must choose the views to document, must choose the notation to document these views, and must choose a set of views that is both minimal and adequate. This may involve combining various views that have a large overlap. You must document not only the structure of the architecture but also the behavior.

Once you have decided on the views, you must decide how to package the documentation. The packaging will depend on the media used for expressing the documentation. Print has different characteristics for understanding and grouping than various online media. Different online media will also have different characteristics.

The context of the project will also affect the documentation. Some of the contextual factors are the important quality attributes of the system, the rate of change of the system, and the project management strategy.

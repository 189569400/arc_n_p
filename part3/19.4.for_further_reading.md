George Fairbanks gives an excellent treatment of architecture and implementation in Chapter 10 of his book Just Enough Software Architecture, which is entitled “The Code Model” [Fairbanks 10].

Mary Shaw long ago recognized the conceptual gap between architecture and implementation and wrote about it eloquently in her article “Procedure Calls Are the Assembly Language of Software Interconnections: Connectors Deserve First-Class Status” [Shaw 94]. In it she pointed out the disparity between rich connectors available in architecture and the impoverished subroutine call that is the mainstay of nearly every programming language.

Architecture-based testing is an active field of research. [Bertolino 96b], [Muccini 07], [Muccini 03], [Eickelman 96], [Pettichord 02], and [Binder 94] specifically address designing systems so that they are more testable. In fact, the three bullets concerning the architect’s role in Section 19.2 are drawn from Pettichord’s work.

Voas [Voas 95] defines testability, identifies its contributing factors, and describes how to measure it.

Bertolino extends Voas’s work and ties testability to dependability [Bertolino 96].

Finally, Baudry et al. have written an interesting paper that examines the testability of well-known design patterns [Baudry 03].

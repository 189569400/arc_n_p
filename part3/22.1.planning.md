22.1 Planning
===

The planning for a project proceeds over time. There is an initial plan that is necessarily top-down to convince upper management to build this system and give them some idea of the cost and schedule. This top-down schedule is inherently going to be incorrect, possibly by large amounts. It does, however, enable the project manager to educate upper managers as to different elements necessary in software development. According to Dan Paulish, based on his experience at Siemens Corporation, some rules of thumb that can be used to estimate the top-down schedule for medium-sized (~150 KSLOC) projects are these:

* Number of components to be estimated: ~150
* Paper design time per component: ~4 hours
* Time between engineering releases: ~8 weeks
* Overall project development allocation:
  * 40 percent design: 5 percent architectural, 35 percent detailed
  * 20 percent coding
  * 40 percent testing

Once the system has been given a go-ahead and a budget, the architecture team is formed and produces an initial architecture design. The budget item deserves some further mention. One case is that the budget is for the whole project and includes the schedule as well. We will call this case top-down planning. The second case is that the budget is just for the architecture design phase. In this case, the overall project budget emerges from the architecture design phase. This provides a gate that the team has to pass through and gives the holders of the purse strings a chance to consider whether the value of the project is worth the cost.

We now describe a merged process that includes both the top-down budget and schedule as well as a bottom-up budget and schedule that emerges from the architecture design phase.

The architecture team produces the initial architecture design and the release plans for the system: what features will be released and when the releases will occur. Once an initial architecture design has been produced, then leads for the various pieces of the project can be assigned and they can build their teams. The definition of the various pieces of the project and their assignment to teams is sometimes called the work breakdown structure. At this point, cost and schedule estimates from the team leads and an overall project schedule can be produced. This bottom-up schedule is usually much more accurate than the top-down schedule, but there may also be significant differences due to differing assumptions. These differences between the top-down and bottom-up schedules need to be discussed and sometimes negotiated. Finally, a software development plan can be written that shows the initial (internal) release as the architectural skeleton with feature-oriented incremental development after that. The features to be in each release are developed in consultation with marketing.

FIGURE 22.1 Overview of planning process

Figure 22.1 shows a process that includes both a top-down schedule and a bottom-up schedule.

Once the software development plan has been written, the teams can determine times and groups for integration and can define the coordination needs for the various projects. As we will see in the subsection on global development in Section 22.2, the coordination needs for distributed teams can be significant.

_**With Jungwoo Ryoo and Phil Laplante**_

_Your personal identity isn’t worth quite as much as it used to be—at least to thieves willing to swipe it. According to experts who monitor such markets, the value of stolen credit card data may range from $3 to as little as 40 cents. That’s down tenfold from a decade ago—even though the cost to an individual who has a credit card stolen can soar into the hundreds of dollars._     
_你的个人身份已经不像以前那么值钱了，至少对那些想偷的小偷来说是这样。据监控此类市场的专家称，被盗信用卡数据的价值可能在3美元到40美分之间。这比十年前下降了十倍，尽管信用卡被盗的个人成本可能飙升至数百美元。_   
—Forbes.com (Taylor Buley. “Hackonomics,” Forbes.com, October 27, 2008, <http://www.forbes.com/2008/10/25/credit-cardtheft-tech-security-cz_tb1024theft.html>)

Security is a measure of the system’s ability to protect data and information from unauthorized access while still providing access to people and systems that are authorized. An action taken against a computer system with the intention of doing harm is called an attack and can take a number of forms. It may be an unauthorized attempt to access data or services or to modify data, or it may be intended to deny services to legitimate users.

安全性是对系统保护数据和信息免遭未经授权访问，同时仍提供对授权人员和系统的访问权的一种度量。 针对计算机系统采取的旨在造成伤害的行为称为攻击，并且可以采取多种形式。 这可能是未经授权的访问数据或服务或修改数据的尝试，或者可能是拒绝向合法用户提供服务。

The simplest approach to characterizing security has three characteristics: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA):

表征安全性的最简单方法具有三个特征：机密性，完整性和可用性（CIA）：

1. _Confidentiality_ is the property that data or services are protected from unauthorized access. For example, a hacker cannot access your income tax returns on a government computer. 

   _机密性_ 是保护数据或服务免遭未授权访问的属性。 例如，黑客无法在政府计算机上访问您的所得税申报表。

2. _Integrity_ is the property that data or services are not subject to unauthorized manipulation. For example, your grade has not been changed since your instructor assigned it. 
   
   _完整性_ 是数据或服务未经未经授权操纵的属性。 例如，自从您的老师给您评分以来，您的成绩没有改变。
   
3. _Availability_ is the property that the system will be available for legitimate use. For example, a denial-of-service attack won’t prevent you from ordering book from an online bookstore. 
   
   _可用性_ 是系统可用于合法使用的属性。 例如，拒绝服务攻击不会阻止您从在线书店订购书籍。

Other characteristics that are used to support CIA are these:

用于支持CIA的其他特征包括：

4. _Authentication_ verifies the identities of the parties to a transaction and checks if they are truly who they claim to be. For example, when you get an email purporting to come from a bank, authentication guarantees that it actually comes from the bank. 

   _身份验证_ 可验证交易各方的身份，并检查他们是否真实地声称自己是谁。 例如，当您收到一封声称来自银行的电子邮件时，身份验证可确保该邮件实际上来自银行。

5. _Nonrepudiation_ guarantees that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message, and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message. For example, you cannot deny ordering something from the Internet, or the merchant cannot disclaim getting your order. 
   
   _不可否认性_ 保证消息的发送者以后不能拒绝发送消息，并且接收者不能拒绝接收消息。 例如，您不能拒绝从Internet订购商品，或者商人不能否认获得您的订单。
   
6. _Authorization_ grants a user the privileges to perform a task. For example, an online banking system authorizes a legitimate user to access his account.
   _授权_ 向用户授予执行任务的特权。 例如，在线银行系统授权合法用户访问其帐户。

We will use these characteristics in our general scenarios for security. Approaches to achieving security can be characterized as those that detect attacks, those that resist attacks, those that react to attacks, and those that recover from successful attacks. The objects that are being protected from attacks are data at rest, data in transit, and computational processes.

为了安全起见，我们将在一般情况下使用这些特征。 可以将实现安全性的方法的特征描述为检测攻击的方法，抵抗攻击的方法，对攻击做出反应的方法以及从成功攻击中恢复的方法。 受保护不受攻击的对象是静态数据、传输中的数据和计算过程。

### 9.1 Security General Scenario 安全性通用场景

One technique that is used in the security domain is threat modeling. An “attack tree,” similar to a fault tree discussed in Chapter 5, is used by security engineers to determine possible threats. The root is a successful attack and the nodes are possible direct causes of that successful attack. Children nodes decompose the direct causes, and so forth. An attack is an attempt to break CIA, and the leaves of attack trees would be the stimulus in the scenario. The response to the attack is to preserve CIA or deter attackers through monitoring of their activities. From these considerations we can now describe the individual portions of a security general scenario. These are ummarized in Table 9.1, and an example security scenario is given in Figure 9.1.

* _Source of stimulus_. The source of the attack may be either a human or another system. It may have been previously identified (either correctly or incorrectly) or may be currently unknown. A human attacker may be from outside the organization or from inside the organization.

* _Stimulus_. The stimulus is an attack. We characterize this as an unauthorized attempt to display data, change or delete data, access system services, change the system’s behavior, or reduce availability.

* _Artifact_. The target of the attack can be either the services of the system, the data within it, or the data produced or consumed by the system. Some attacks are made on particular components of the system known to be vulnerable.

* _Environment_. The attack can come when the system is either online or offline, either connected to or disconnected from a network, either behind a firewall or open to a network, fully operational, partially operational, or not operational.

* _Response_. The system should ensure that transactions are carried out in a fashion such that data or services are protected from unauthorized access; data or services are not being manipulated without authorization; parties to a transaction are identified with assurance; the parties to the transaction cannot repudiate their involvements; and the data, resources, and system services will be available for legitimate use.  

  The system should also track activities within it by recording access or modification; attempts to access data, resources, or services; and noti-fying appropriate entities (people or systems) when an apparent attack is occurring.

* _Response measure_. Measures of a system’s response include how much of a system is compromised when a particular component or data value is compromised, how much time passed before an attack was detected, how many attacks were resisted, how long it took to recover from a successful attack, and how much data was vulnerable to a particular attack. 

Table 9.1 enumerates the elements of the general scenario, which charac-terize security, and Figure 9.1 shows a sample concrete scenario: A disgruntled employee from a remote location attempts to modify the pay rate table during normal operations. The system maintains an audit trail, and the correct data is restored within a day.

### 9.2 Tactics for Security 安全性策略

One method for thinking about how to achieve security in a system is to think about physical security. Secure installations have limited access (e.g., by using security checkpoints), have means of detecting intruders (e.g., by requiring le-gitimate visitors to wear badges), have deterrence mechanisms such as armed guards, have reaction mechanisms such as automatic locking of doors, and have recovery mechanisms such as off-site backup. These lead to our four categories of tactics: detect, resist, react, and recover. Figure 9.2 shows these categories as the goal of security tactics.

![](fig.9.2)
FIGURE 9.2 The goal of security tactics

#### Detect Attacks
The detect attacks category consists of four tactics: detect intrusion, detect service denial, verify message integrity, and detect message delay.
* _Detect intrusion_ is the comparison of network traffic or service request patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of malicious behavior stored in a database. The signatures can be based on protocol, TCP flags, payload sizes, applications, source or destination address, or port number.
* _Detect service denial_ is the comparison of the pattern or signature of network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-service attacks.
* _Verify message integrity_. This tactic employs techniques such as checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource files, deployment files, and configuration files. A checksum is a validation mechanism wherein the system maintains redundant information for configuration files and messages, and uses this redundant information to verify the configuration file or message when it is used. A hash value is a unique string generated by a hashing function whose input could be configuration files or messages. Even a slight change in the original files or messages results in a significant change in the hash value.
* _Detect message delay_ is intended to detect potential man-in-the-middle attacks, where a malicious party is intercepting (and possibly modifying) messages. By checking the time that it takes to deliver a message, it is possible to detect suspicious timing behavior, where the time it takes to deliver a message is highly variable.

#### Resist Attacks
There are a number of well-known means of resisting an attack:
* _Identify actors_. Identifying “actors” is really about identifying the source of any external input to the system. Users are typically identified through user IDs. Other systems may be “identified” through access codes, IP addresses, protocols, ports, and so on.
* _Authenticate actors_. Authentication means ensuring that an actor (a user or a remote computer) is actually who or what it purports to be. Passwords, one-time passwords, digital certificates, and biometric identification provide a means for authentication.
* _Authorize actors_. Authorization means ensuring that an authenticated actor has the rights to access and modify either data or services. This mechanism is usually enabled by providing some access control mechanisms within a system. Access control can be by an actor or by an actor class. Classes of actors can be defined by actor groups, by actor roles, or by lists of individuals.
* _Limit access_. Limiting access involves controlling what and who may access which parts of a system. This may include limiting access to resources such as processors, memory, and network connections, which may be achieved by using process management, memory protection, blocking a host, closing a port, or rejecting a protocol. For example, a firewall is a single point of access to an organization’s intranet. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a subnet between the Internet and an intranet, protected by two firewalls: one facing the Internet and the other the intranet. A DMZ is used when an organization wants to let external users access services that should be publicly vailable outside the intranet. This way the number of open ports in the internal firewall can be minimized. This tactic also limits access for actors (by identifying, authenticating, and authorizing them).
* _Limit exposure_. Limiting exposure refers to ultimately and indirectly reducing the probability of a successful attack, or restricting the amount of potential damage. This can be achieved by concealing facts about a system to be protected (“security by obscurity”) or by dividing and distributing critical resources so that the exploitation of a single weakness cannot fully compromise any resource (“don’t put all your eggs in one basket”). For example, a design decision to hide how many entry points a system has is a way of limiting exposure. A decision to distribute servers amongst several geographically dispersed data centers is also a way of limiting exposure.
* _Encrypt data_. Data should be protected from unauthorized access. Confidentiality is usually achieved by applying some form of encryption to data and to communication. Encryption provides extra protection to persistently maintained data beyond that available from authorization. Communication links, on the other hand, may not have authorization controls. In such cases, encryption is the only protection for passing data over publicly accessible communication links. The link can be implemented by a virtual private network (VPN) or by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for a web-based link. Encryption can be symmetric (both parties use the same key) or asymmetric (public and private keys).
* _Separate entities_. Separating different entities within the system can be done through physical separation on different servers that are attached to different networks; the use of virtual machines (see Chapter 26 for a discussion of virtual machines); or an “air gap,” that is, by having no connection between different portions of a system. Finally, sensitive data is frequently separated from nonsensitive data to reduce the attack possibilities from those who have access to nonsensitive data.
* _Change default settings_. Many systems have default settings assigned when the system is delivered. Forcing the user to change those settings will prevent attackers from gaining access to the system through settings that are, generally, publicly available. 

#### React to Attacks 
Several tactics are intended to respond to a potential attack:
* _Revoke access_. If the system or a system administrator believes that an attack is underway, then access can be severely limited to sensitive resources, even for normally legitimate users and uses. For example, if your desktop has been compromised by a virus, your access to certain resources may be limited until the virus is removed from your system.
* _Lock computer_. Repeated failed login attempts may indicate a potential attack. Many systems limit access from a particular computer if there are repeated failed attempts to access an account from that computer. Legitimate users may make mistakes in attempting to log in. Therefore, the limited access may only be for a certain time period.
* _Inform actors_. Ongoing attacks may require action by operators, other personnel, or cooperating systems. Such personnel or systems—the set of relevant actors—must be notified when the system has detected an attack. 

#### Recover from Attacks
Once a system has detected and attempted to resist an attack, it needs to recover. Part of recovery is restoration of services. For example, additional servers or net-work connections may be kept in reserve for such a purpose. Since a successful attack can be considered a kind of failure, the set of availability tactics (from Chapter 5) that deal with recovering from a failure can be brought to bear for this aspect of security as well.

In addition to the availability tactics that permit restoration of services, we need to maintain an audit trail. We audit—that is, keep a record of user and sys-tem actions and their effects—to help trace the actions of, and to identify, an at-tacker. We may analyze audit trails to attempt to prosecute attackers, or to create better defenses in the future.

The set of security tactics is shown in Figure 9.3.

Mapping among Architectural Elements | Determine how alternative mappings of architectural elements that are under consideration may change how an individual or system may read, write, or modify data; access system services or resources; or reduce availability to system services or resources. Determine how alternative mappings may affect the recording of access to data, services or resources and the recognition of unexpectedly high demands for resources. <br>For each such mapping, ensure that there are responsibilities to do the following: <br><li> Identify an actor <br><li> Authenticate an actor <br><li> Authorize actors <br><li> Grant or deny access to data or services <br><li> Record attempts to access or modify data or services <br><li> Encrypt data <br><li> Recognize reduced availability for resources or services, inform appropriate personnel, and restrict access <br><li> Recover from an attack

Choice of Technology | Determine what technologies are available to help user authentication, data access rights, resource protection, and data encryption. <br>Ensure that your chosen technologies support the tactics relevant for your security needs.

### 9.4 Summary 小结

Attacks against a system can be characterized as attacks against the confidential-ity, integrity, or availability of a system or its data. Confidentiality means keeping data away from those who should not have access while granting access to those who should. Integrity means that there are no unauthorized modifications to or deletion of data, and availability means that the system is accessible to those who are entitled to use it.

The emphasis of distinguishing various classes of actors in the characteri-zation leads to many of the tactics used to achieve security. Identifying, authen-ticating, and authorizing actors are tactics intended to determine which users or systems are entitled to what kind of access to a system.

An assumption is made that no security tactic is foolproof and that systems will be compromised. Hence, tactics exist to detect an attack, limit the spread of any attack, and to react and recover from an attack.

Recovering from an attack involves many of the same tactics as availability and, in general, involves returning the system to a consistent state prior to any attack.

### 9.5 For Further Reading 进一步阅读

The architectural tactics that we have described in this chapter are only one as-pect of making a system secure. Other aspects are these:

* Coding. Secure Coding in C and C++ [Seacord 05] describes how to code securely. The Common Weakness Enumeration [CWE 12] is a list of the most common vulnerabilities discovered in systems.
* Organizational processes. Organizations must have processes that provide for responsibility for various aspects of security, including ensuring that systems are patched to put into place the latest protections. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides an enumeration of organizational processes [NIST 09]. [Cappelli 12] discusses insider threats.
* Technical processes. Microsoft has a life-cycle development process (The Secure Development Life Cycle) that includes modeling of threats. Four training classes are publicly available. www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=16420

NIST has several volumes that give definitions of security terms [NIST 04], categories of security controls [NIST 06], and an enumeration of security con-trols that an organization could employ [NIST 09]. A security control could be a tactic, but it could also be organizational, coding-related, or a technical process.

The attack surface of a system is the code that can be run by unauthorized users. A discussion of how to minimize the attack surface for a system can be found at [Howard 04].

Encryption and certificates of various types and strengths are commonly used to resist certain types of attacks. Encryption algorithms are particularly dif-ficult to code correctly. A document produced by NIST [NIST 02] gives require-ments for these algorithms.

Good books on engineering systems for security have been written by Ross Anderson [Anderson 08] and Bruce Schneier [Schneier 08].

Different domains have different specific sets of practices. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) has a set of standards intended for those involved in credit card processing (www.pcisecuritystandards.org). There is also a set of recom-mendations for securing various portions of the electric grid (www.smartgridipe-dia.org/index.php/ASAP-SG).

Data on the various sources of data breaches can be found in the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigations Report [Verizon 12].

John Viega has written several books about secure software development in various environments. See, for example, [Viega 01].

### 9.6 Discussion Questions 问题讨论

1. Write a set of concrete scenarios for security for an automatic teller ma-chine. How would you modify your design for the automatic teller machine to satisfy these scenarios?
2. One of the most sophisticated attacks on record was carried out by a virus known as Stuxnet. Stuxnet first appeared in 2009 but became widely known in 2011 when it was revealed that it had apparently severely damaged or incapacitated the high-speed centrifuges involved in Iran’s uranium en-richment program. Read about Stuxnet and see if you can devise a defense
strategy against it based on the tactics in this chapter.

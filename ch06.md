—Rube Goldberg, instructions for “a simple alarm clock” 鲁布·戈德伯格 “简易闹钟”说明

Interoperability is about the degree to which two or more systems can usefully exchange meaningful information via interfaces in a particular context. The definition includes not only having the ability to exchange data (syntactic interoperability) but also having the ability to correctly interpret the data being exchanged (semantic interoperability). A system cannot be interoperable in isolation. Any discussion of a system’s interoperability needs to identify with whom, with what, and under what circumstances—hence, the need to include the context.

互操作性大约是指两个或多个系统可以在特定上下文中通过接口有效交换有意义的信息的程度。 该定义不仅包括具有交换数据的能力（语法互操作性），而且还具有正确解释正在交换的数据的能力（语义互操作性）。 系统不能孤立地互操作。 对系统互操作性的任何讨论都需要确定与谁，什么以及在什么情况下（因此需要包含上下文）。

Interoperability is affected by the systems expected to interoperate. If we already know the interfaces of external systems with which our system will interoperate, then we can design that knowledge into the system. Or we can design our system to interoperate in a more generic fashion, so that the identity and the services that another system provides can be bound later in the life cycle, at build time or runtime.

互操作性受预期可互操作的系统的影响。 如果我们已经知道与系统进行互操作的外部系统的接口，则可以将这些知识设计到系统中。 或者我们可以将系统设计为以更通用的方式进行互操作，以便可以在生命周期的后期，构建时或运行时绑定其他系统提供的标识和服务。

Like all quality attributes, interoperability is not a yes-or-no proposition but has shades of meaning. There are several characterizing frameworks for interoperability, all of which seem to define five levels of interoperability “maturity” (see the “For Further Reading” section at the end of this chapter for a pointer). The lowest level signifies systems that do not share data at all, or do not do so with any success. The highest level signifies systems that work together seamlessly, never make any mistakes interpreting each other’s communications, and share the same underlying semantic model of the world in which they work.

像所有质量属性一样，互操作性不是“是或不是”的命题，而是具有深浅的含义。 有几个互操作性的特征描述框架，它们似乎都定义了五个级别的互操作性“成熟度”（有关指针，请参见本章末尾的“更多阅读”部分）。 最低级别表示完全不共享数据或不成功共享数据的系统。 最高级别表示系统可以无缝协作，在解释彼此的通信时不会犯任何错误，并且共享与工作环境相同的基本语义模型。

> **“通过接口交换信息”**
>
> Interoperability, as we said, is about two or more systems exchanging information via interfaces.
>
> 正如我们所说，互操作性大约是两个或多个通过接口交换信息的系统。
>
> At this point, we need to clarify two critical concepts central to this discussion and emphasize that we are taking a broad view of each.
>
> 在这一点上，我们需要澄清两个关键概念，这是讨论的核心，并强调我们对每个概念都具有广泛的看法。
>
> The first is what it means to “exchange information.” This can mean something as simple as program A calling program B with some parameters. However, two systems (or parts of a system) can exchange information even if they never communicate directly with each other. Did you ever have a conversation like the following in junior high school? “Charlene said that Kim told her that Trevor heard that Heather wants to come to your party.” Of course, junior high school protocol would preclude the possibility of responding directly to Heather. Instead, your response (if you like Heather) might be, “Cool,” which would make its way back through Charlene, Kim, and Trevor. You and Heather exchanged information, but never talked to each other. (We hope you got to talk to each other at the party.)
>
> 第一个是“交换信息”的含义。这可能意味着像程序A这样简单的事情，它调用带有某些参数的程序B。 但是，即使两个系统（或系统的一部分）从不相互直接通信，也可以交换信息。 在初中时，您是否曾经有过如下对话？ “夏琳说金告诉她，特雷弗听说希瑟想参加你的聚会。”当然，初中的协议将排除直接回应希瑟的可能性。 相反，您的回答（如果您喜欢Heather）可能是“酷”，它将通过Charlene，Kim和Trevor返回。 您和希瑟（Heather）交换了信息，但从未互相交谈。 （我们希望您在聚会上能互相交谈。）
>
> Entities can exchange information in even less direct ways. If I have an idea of a program’s behavior, and I design my program to work assuming that behavior, the two programs have also exchanged information—just not at runtime.
>
> 实体可以以更少直接的方式交换信息。 如果我对某个程序的行为有一个了解，并且我将程序设计为在假定该行为的情况下运行，那么这两个程序也已经交换了信息，而不仅仅是在运行时。
>
> One of the more infamous software disasters in history occurred when an antimissile system failed to intercept an incoming ballistic rocket in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, resulting in 28 fatalities. One of the missile’s software components “expected” to be shut down and restarted periodically, so it could recalibrate its orientation framework from a known initial point. The software had been running for some 100 hours when the missile was launched, and calculation errors had accumulated to the point where the software component’s idea of its orientation had wandered hopelessly away from truth.
>
> 历史上最臭名昭著的软件灾难之一是，1991年反导系统未能拦截“沙漠风暴”行动中的一枚弹道导弹，造成28人死亡。 导弹的软件组件之一“有望”被关闭并定期重启，因此它可以从已知的起点重新校准其定向框架。 导弹发射时，该软件已经运行了大约100个小时，并且计算错误已累积到一定程度，以至于该软件组件的定向概念已无可救药地偏离了事实。
>
> Systems (or components within systems) often have or embody expectations about the behaviors of its “information exchange” partners. The assumption of everything interacting with the errant component in the preceding example was that its accuracy did not degrade over time. The result was a system of parts that did not work together correctly to solve the problem they were supposed to.
>
> 系统（或系统中的组件）通常对其“信息交换”合作伙伴的行为抱有或体现期望。 在前面的示例中，所有与错误组件交互的假设都是其准确性不会随时间而降低。 结果是零件系统无法正确协作以解决它们应解决的问题。
>
> The second concept we need to stress is what we mean by “interface.” Once again, we mean something beyond the simple case—a syntactic description of a component’s programs and the type and number of their parameters, most commonly realized as an API. That’s necessary for interoperability—heck, it’s necessary if you want your software to compile successfully—but it’s not sufficient. To illustrate this concept, we’ll use another “conversation” analogy. Has your partner or spouse ever come home, slammed the door, and when you ask what’s wrong, replied “Nothing!”? If so, then you should be able to appreciate the keen difference between syntax and semantics and the role of expectations in understanding how an entity behaves. Because we want interoperable systems and components, and not simply ones that compile together nicely, we require a higher bar for interfaces than just a statement of syntax. By “interface,” we mean the set of assumptions that you can safely make about an entity. For example, it’s a safe assumption that whatever’s wrong with your spouse/partner, it’s not “Nothing,” and you know that because that “interface” extends way beyond just the words they say. And it’s also a safe assumption that nothing about our missile component’s accuracy degradation over time was in its API, and yet that was a critical part of its interface.
>
> 我们需要强调的第二个概念是“接口”的含义。我们再一次指的是简单情况之外的东西-组件程序的语法描述及其参数的类型和数量，通常以API的形式实现。这对于实现互操作性是必要的-哎呀，如果您希望软件成功编译是必要的-但还不够。为了说明这个概念，我们将使用另一个“对话”类比。您的伴侣或配偶是否曾经回家，砸过门，当您问出什么问题时，回答“没事！”？如果是这样，那么您应该能够理解语法和语义之间的敏锐差异以及期望在理解实体行为方面的作用。因为我们需要可互操作的系统和组件，而不是简单地很好地编译在一起的系统和组件，所以我们要求接口的标准更高，而不仅仅是语法声明。所谓“接口”，是指您可以安全地对实体进行的一系列假设。例如，可以安全地假设您的配偶/伴侣有什么毛病，不是“什么都没有”，您知道那是因为“接口”不仅限于他们所说的话。而且这也是一个安全的假设，即我们的导弹组件的API随时间的推移不会降低精度，但这是其界面的关键部分。

Here are some of the reasons you might want systems to interoperate:

您可能希望系统进行互操作的一些原因如下：

* Your system provides a service to be used by a collection of unknown systems. These systems need to interoperate with your system even though you may know nothing about them. An example is a service such as Google Maps.
   您的系统提供了供未知系统集合使用的服务。 这些系统需要与您的系统进行互操作，即使您可能对它们一无所知。 一个示例是诸如Google Maps之类的服务。
* You are constructing capabilities from existing systems. For example, one of the existing systems is responsible for sensing its environment, another one is responsible for processing the raw data, a third is responsible for interpreting the data, and a final one is responsible for producing and distributing a representation of what was sensed. An example is a traffic sensing system where the input comes from individual vehicles, the raw data is processed into common units of measurement, is interpreted and fused, and traffic congestion information is broadcast.
   您正在从现有系统中构建功能。 例如，一个现有系统负责感测其环境，另一个系统负责处理原始数据，第三个系统负责解释数据，最后一个系统负责生成和分发所感测的内容的表示形式。 。 一个示例是交通传感系统，其中输入来自各个车辆，原始数据被处理为通用的度量单位，被解释和融合，并广播交通拥堵信息。

These examples highlight two important aspects of interoperability:

这些示例突出了互操作性的两个重要方面：

1. _Discovery_. The consumer of a service must discover (possibly at runtime, possibly prior to runtime) the location, identity, and the interface of the service.  
   _发现_。 服务的使用者必须发现（可能在运行时，可能在运行时之前）服务的位置，身份和接口。
2. _Handling of the response_. There are three distinct possibilities:  
   _处理响应_。 有三种不同的可能性：
   * The service reports back to the requester with the response.
      服务将响应报告给请求者。
   * The service sends its response on to another system.
      服务将其响应发送到另一个系统。
   * The service broadcasts its response to any interested parties.
      该服务将其响应广播给任何感兴趣的各方。

These elements, discovery and disposition of response, along with management of interfaces, govern our discussion of scenarios and tactics for interoperability.

这些要素（响应的发现和处置以及接口的管理）控制着我们对场景和互操作性策略的讨论。

> If you have a group of systems that are interoperating to achieve a joint purpose, you have what is called a system of systems (SoS). An SoS is an arrangement of systems that results when independent and useful systems are integrated into a larger system that delivers unique capabilities. Table 6.1 shows a categorization of SoSs.
>
> 如果您有一组相互协作以实现共同目的的系统，那么您将拥有所谓的系统的系统（SoS）。 SoS是系统的布置，当将独立且有用的系统集成到提供独特功能的较大系统中时，就会产生结果。 表6.1显示了SoS的分类。
>

> **表6.1系统的系统分类**
>
> . | . 
> --|--
> Directed | SoS objectives, centralized management, funding, and authority for the overall SoS are in place. Systems are subordinated to the SoS.
> Acknowledged | SoS objectives, centralized management, funding, and authority in place. However, systems retain their own management, funding, and authority in parallel with the SoS.
> Collaborative | There are no overall objectives, centralized management, authority, responsibility, or funding at the SoS level. Systems voluntarily work together to address shared or common interests.
> Virtual | Like collaborative, but systems don’t know about each other.
>

>
> _* The taxonomy shown is an extension of work done by Mark Maier in 1998._  
> _* 显示的分类法是Mark Maier在1998年所做工作的延伸。_
>
> In directed and acknowledged SoSs, there is a deliberate attempt to create an SoS. The key difference is that in the former, there is SoS-level management that exercises control over the constituent systems, while in the latter, the constituent systems retain a high degree of autonomy in their own evolution. Collaborative and virtual systems of systems are more ad hoc, absent an overarching authority or source of funding and, in the case of a virtual SoS, even absent the knowledge about the scope and membership of the SoS.
>
> 在定向和公认的SoS中，有意创建SoS。 关键的区别在于，在前者中，存在SoS级管理来对组成系统进行控制，而在后者中，组成系统在其自身的演化中保留了高度的自治性。 系统的协作和虚拟系统更特别，缺少总体权限或资金来源，对于虚拟SoS，甚至缺少关于SoS范围和成员资格的知识。
>
> The collaborative case is quite common. Consider the Google Maps example from the introduction. Google is the manager and funding authority for the map service. Each use of the maps in an application (an SoS) has its own management and funding authority, and there is no overall management of all of the applications that use Google Maps. The various organizations involved in the applications collaborate (either explicitly or implicitly) to enable the applications to work correctly.
>
> 合作案例非常普遍。 考虑一下引言中的Google Maps示例。 Google是地图服务的管理者和资助机构。 应用程序（SoS）中对地图的每次使用都有其自己的管理和资金授权，并且对使用Google Maps的所有应用程序没有全面的管理。 应用程序中涉及的各种组织（显式或隐式）进行协作以使应用程序正常工作。
>
> A virtual SoS involves large systems and is much more ad hoc. For example, there are over 3,000 electric companies in the U.S. electric grid, each state has a public utility commission that oversees the utility companies operating in its state, and the federal Department of Energy provides some level of policy guidance. Many of the systems within the electric grid must interoperate, but there is no management authority for the overall system.
>
> 虚拟SoS涉及大型系统，并且是临时性的。 例如，美国电网中有3,000多家电力公司，每个州都有一个公用事业委员会，负责监督在该州运营的公用事业公司，而联邦能源部则提供一定程度的政策指导。 电网中的许多系统必须可以互操作，但是整个系统没有管理权限。

### 6.1 Interoperability General Scenario 互操作性通用场景

The following are the portions of an interoperability general scenario:

以下是互操作性通用方案的各个部分：

* _Source of stimulus_. A system that initiates a request.
* _刺激的来源_。 发起请求的系统。
* _Stimulus_. A request to exchange information among systems.
* _刺激_。 在系统之间交换信息的请求。
* _Artifacts_. The systems that wish to interoperate.
* _对象_。 希望互操作的系统。
* _Environment_. The systems that wish to interoperate are discovered at runtime or are known prior to runtime.
* _环境_。 希望互操作的系统是在运行时发现的，或者在运行前就已经知道的。
* _Response_. The request to interoperate results in the exchange of information. The information is understood by the receiving party both syntactically and semantically. Alternatively, the request is rejected and appropriate entities are notified. In either case, the request may be logged.
* _反应_。 互操作的请求导致信息交换。 接收方在语法和语义上都可以理解该信息。 可替代地，该请求被拒绝并且适当的实体被通知。 无论哪种情况，都可以记录该请求。
* _Response measure_. The percentage of information exchanges correctly processed or the percentage of information exchanges correctly rejected.
* _反应测量_。 正确处理的信息交换的百分比或正确拒绝的信息交换的百分比。

Figure 6.1 gives an example: Our vehicle information system sends our current location to the traffic monitoring system. The traffic monitoring system combines our location with other information, overlays this information on a Google Map, and broadcasts it. Our location information is correctly included with a probability of 99.9%. 

图6.1给出了一个示例：我们的车辆信息系统将我们的当前位置发送到交通监控系统。 交通监控系统将我们的位置与其他信息结合在一起，将此信息叠加在Google Map上并进行广播。 正确包含我们的位置信息的可能性为99.9％。

> **SOAP vs. REST**
>
> If you want to allow web-based applications to interoperate, you have two major off-the-shelf technology options today: (1) WS* and SOAP (which once stood for “Simple Object Access Protocol,” but that acronym is no longer blessed) and (2) REST (which stands for “Representation State Transfer,” and therefore is sometimes spelled ReST). How can we compare these technologies? What is each good for? What are the road hazards you need to be aware of? This is a bit of an apples-and-oranges comparison, but I will try to sketch the landscape.
>
> 如果要允许基于Web的应用程序进行互操作，那么今天有两个主要的现成技术选项：（1）WS*和SOAP（它们曾经代表“简单对象访问协议”，但是这个缩写已经不受欢迎了 （2）REST（代表“表示状态传输”，因此有时拼写为ReST）。 我们如何比较这些技术？ 每个都有什么用？ 您需要注意哪些道路危险？ 这有点像橘子和苹果的对比，但我会尝试绘制草图。
>
> SOAP is a protocol specification for XML-based information that distributed applications can use to exchange information and hence interoperate. It is most often accompanied by a set of SOA middleware interoperability standards and compliant implementations, referred to (collectively) as WS*. SOAP and WS* together define many standards, including the following:
>
> SOAP是针对基于XML的信息的协议规范，分布式应用程序可以使用它来交换信息，从而实现互操作。 它通常伴随有一组SOA中间件互操作性标准和兼容的实现，（统称为WS *）。 SOAP和WS *共同定义了许多标准，包括以下内容：
>
> * _An infrastructure for service composition_. SOAP can employ the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) as a way to let developers express business processes that are implemented as WS* services.
> * _服务组合的基础架构_。 SOAP可以采用业务流程执行语言（BPEL）作为一种方法，使开发人员可以表达以WS *服务实现的业务流程。
> * _Transactions_. There are several web-service standards for ensuring that transactions are properly managed: WS-AT, WS-BA, WS-CAF, and WS-Transaction.
> * _交易_。 有几种Web服务标准可确保正确管理事务：WS-AT，WS-BA，WS-CAF和WS-Transaction。
> * _Service discovery_. The Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) language enables businesses to publish service listings and discover each other.
> * _服务发现_。 通用描述，发现和集成（UDDI）语言使企业可以发布服务列表并相互发现。
> * Reliability. SOAP, by itself, does not ensure reliable message delivery. Applications that require such guarantees must use services compliant with SOAP’s reliability standard: WS-Reliability.
> * _可靠性_。 SOAP本身不能确保可靠的消息传递。 需要此类保证的应用程序必须使用符合SOAP可靠性标准的服务：WS-Reliability。
>
> SOAP is quite general and has its roots in a remote procedure call (RPC) model of interacting applications, although other models are certainly possible. SOAP has a simple type system, comparable to that found in the major programming languages. SOAP relies on HTTP and RPC for message transmission, but it could, in theory, be implemented on top of any communication protocol. SOAP does not mandate a service’s method names, addressing model, or procedural conventions. Thus, choosing SOAP buys little actual interoperability between applications—it is just an information exchange standard. The interacting applications need to agree on how to interpret the payload, which is where you get semantic interoperability.
>
> SOAP非常通用，其根源是与应用程序交互的远程过程调用（RPC）模型，尽管其他模型当然也是可能的。 SOAP具有简单的类型系统，可与主要编程语言中的类型系统相比。 SOAP依靠HTTP和RPC进行消息传输，但是从理论上讲，它可以在任何通信协议之上实现。 SOAP并不要求服务的方法名称，寻址模型或程序约定。 因此，选择SOAP几乎不会带来应用程序之间的实际互操作性-它只是一种信息交换标准。 交互的应用程序需要就如何解释有效负载达成共识，这是获得语义互操作性的地方。
>
> REST, on the other hand, is a client-server-based architectural style that is structured around a small set of create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations (called POST, GET, PUT, DELETE respectively in the REST world) and a single addressing scheme (based on a URI, or uniform resource identifier). REST imposes few constraints on an architecture: SOAP offers completeness; REST offers simplicity.
>
> 另一方面，REST是一种基于客户端-服务器的体系结构样式，其结构围绕一整套创建，读取，更新，删除（CRUD）操作（在REST世界中分别称为POST，GET，PUT，DELETE） ）和单个寻址方案（基于URI或统一资源标识符）。 REST对体系结构没有什么限制：SOAP提供完整性； REST提供了简单性。
>
> REST is about state and state transfer and views the web (and the services that service-oriented systems can string together) as a huge network of information that is accessible by a single URI-based addressing scheme. There is no notion of type and hence no type checking in REST—it is up to the applications to get the semantics of interaction right.
>
> REST涉及状态和状态转移，并将Web（以及面向服务的系统可以串连在一起的服务）视为一个巨大的信息网络，可通过单个基于URI的寻址方案访问。 没有类型的概念，因此在REST中没有类型检查-由应用程序决定正确的交互语义。
>
> Because REST interfaces are so simple and general, any HTTP client can talk to any HTTP server, using the REST operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) with no further configuration. That buys you syntactic interoperability, but of course there must be organization-level agreement about what these programs actually do and what information they exchange. That is, semantic interoperability is not guaranteed between services just because both have REST interfaces.
>
> 因为REST接口是如此简单和通用，所以任何HTTP客户端都可以使用REST操作（POST，GET，PUT，DELETE）与任何HTTP服务器进行对话，而无需进一步配置。 这为您带来了语法上的互操作性，但是，当然，对于这些程序的实际作用以及它们交换的信息，必须在组织级别达成一致。 也就是说，仅因为两个服务都有REST接口，就不能保证服务之间的语义互操作性。
>
> REST, on top of HTTP, is meant to be self-descriptive and in the best case is a stateless protocol. Consider the following example, in REST, of a phone book service that allows someone to look up a person, given some unique identifier for that person:
>
> 在HTTP之上的REST是自描述的，最好是无状态协议。 考虑以下在REST中的电话簿服务示例，该示例允许某人查找某人，并为其提供了一些唯一标识符：
>
> `http://www.XYZdirectory.com/phonebook/UserInfo/99999`  
> <http://www.XYZdirectory.com/phonebook/UserInfo/99999>
>
> The same simple lookup, implemented in SOAP, would be specified as something like the following:
>
> 将用SOAP实现相同的简单查找，如下所示：
>
> ```xml
> <?xml version=”1.0”?>
> <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope

>       <pb:UserIdentifier>99999</pb:UserIdentifier>
>     </pb:GetUserInfo>
>   </soap:Body>
> </soap:Envelope>
> ```
>
> One aspect of the choice between SOAP and REST is whether you want to accept the complexity and restrictions of SOAP+WSDL (the Web Services Description Language) to get more standardized interoperability or if you want to avoid the overhead by using REST, but perhaps benefit from less standardization. What are the other considerations?
>
> 在SOAP和REST之间进行选择的一个方面是您是否要接受SOAP + WSDL（Web服务描述语言）的复杂性和限制以获得更标准的互操作性，或者是否要通过使用REST来避免开销，但是也许 受益于标准化程度降低。 还有哪些其他考虑因素？
>
> A message exchange in REST has somewhat fewer characters than a message exchange in SOAP. So one of the tradeoffs in the choice between REST and SOAP is the size of the individual messages. For systems exchanging a large number of messages, another tradeoff is between performance (favoring REST) and structured messages (favoring SOAP).
>
> REST中的消息交换比SOAP中的消息交换具有更少的字符。 因此，在REST和SOAP之间进行选择的权衡之一就是各个消息的大小。 对于交换大量消息的系统，另一个折衷是在性能（支持REST）和结构化消息（支持SOAP）之间。
>
> The decision to implement WS* or REST will depend on aspects such as the quality of service (QoS) required—WS* implementation has greater support for security, availability, and so on—and type of functionality. A RESTful implementation, because of its simplicity, is more appropriate for read-only functionality, typical of mashups, where there are minimal QoS requirements and concerns.
>
> 实施WS* 或REST的决定将取决于以下方面，例如所需的服务质量（QoS）-WS* 实施对安全性，可用性等具有更大的支持-以及功能类型。 RESTful实施由于其简单性而更适合于mashup的典型只读功能，在这种情况下，QoS要求和关注最小。
>
> OK, so if you are building a service-based system, how do you choose? The truth is, you don’t have to make a single choice, once and for all time; each technology is reasonably easy to use, at least for simple applications. And each has its strengths and weaknesses. Like everything else in architecture, it’s all about the tradeoffs; your decision will likely hinge on the way those tradeoffs affect your system in your context.
>
> 因此，如果您要构建基于服务的系统，该如何选择？ 事实是，您不必一次又一次地做出单一选择； 至少对于简单的应用程序，每种技术都相当容易使用。 每个都有其优点和缺点。 就像架构中的所有其他内容一样，这都是折衷方案。 您的决定可能取决于这些权衡在您的环境中影响系统的方式。

### 6.2 Tactics for Interoperability 互操作性策略

Figure 6.2 shows the goal of the set of interoperability tactics.

图6.2显示了这套互操作性策略的目标。

![]()
Figure 6.2 Goal of interoperability tactics 互操作策略的目标

We identify two categories of interoperability tactics: locate and manage interfaces.

我们确定了两类互操作性策略：查找和管理接口。

**Locate 定位**

There is only one tactic in this category: _discover service_. It is used when the systems that interoperate must be discovered at runtime.

此类别中只有一种策略：_发现服务_。 当必须在运行时发现可互操作的系统时使用它。

* _Discover service_. Locate a service through searching a known directory service. (By “service,” we simply mean a set of capabilities that is accessible via some kind of interface.) There may be multiple levels of indirection in this location process—that is, a known location points to another location that in turn can be searched for the service. The service can be located by type of service, by name, by location, or by some other attribute.
* _发现服务_。 通过搜索已知的目录服务来找到服务。 （通过“服务”，我们简单地表示可以通过某种接口访问的一组功能。）在此定位过程中可能存在多个间接级别，即，已知位置指向另一个位置，而该位置又可以 搜索服务。 可以通过服务类型，名称，位置或其他属性来定位服务。

**Manage Interfaces 管理接口**

Managing interfaces consists of two tactics: orchestrate and tailor interface.

管理接口包括两种策略：编排和剪裁接口。

* _Orchestrate_. Orchestrate is a tactic that uses a control mechanism to coordinate and manage and sequence the invocation of particular services (which could be ignorant of each other). Orchestration is used when the interoperating systems must interact in a complex fashion to accomplish a complex task; orchestration “scripts” the interaction. Workflow engines are an example of the use of the orchestrate tactic. The mediator design pattern can serve this function for simple orchestration. Complex orchestration can be specified in a language such as BPEL.
* _编排_。 Orchestrate是一种策略，它使用控制机制来协调和管理特定服务的调用并对其进行排序（这些服务可能彼此不了解）。 当互操作系统必须以复杂的方式交互以完成复杂的任务时，将使用编排。 编排“脚本”交互。 工作流引擎是使用协调策略的一个示例。 介体设计模式可以充当简单编排的功能。 可以使用诸如BPEL之类的语言来指定复杂的业务流程。
* _Tailor interface_. Tailor interface is a tactic that adds or removes capabilities to an interface. Capabilities such as translation, adding buffering, or smoothing data can be added. Capabilities may be removed as well. An example of removing capabilities is to hide particular functions from untrusted users. The decorator pattern is an example of the tailor interface tactic.
* _剪裁接口_。 剪裁接口是一种在接口上添加或删除功能的策略。 可以添加诸如转换，添加缓冲或平滑数据之类的功能。 功能也可能被删除。 删除功能的一个示例是向不受信任的用户隐藏特定功能。 装饰器模式是定制界面策略的一个示例。

The enterprise service bus that underlies many service-oriented architectures combines both of the manage interface tactics.

基于许多面向服务的体系结构的企业服务总线结合了两种管理接口策略。

> Developer of System A needs to exchange product data with System B. Developer A finds that there is an existing WS* web service interface for sending product data that among other fields contains price expressed in XML Schema as a decimal with two fraction digits. Developer A writes code to interact with the web service and the system works perfectly. However, after two weeks of operation, there is a huge discrepancy between the totals reported by System A and the totals reported by System B. After conversations between the two developers, they discover that System B expected to receive a price that included tax and System A was sending it without tax.

> 系统A的开发人员需要与系统B交换产品数据。开发人员A发现存在用于发送产品数据的WS* Web服务接口，该接口在其他字段中包含以XML Schema表示的价格（用两位小数表示）。 开发人员A编写了与Web服务交互的代码，并且系统运行良好。 但是，在运行两周后，系统A报告的总数与系统B报告的总数之间存在巨大差异。在两个开发人员进行交谈之后，他们发现系统B期望收到的含税价格但和系统A发送的价格不含税。
>
> This is a simple example of why standards are not enough. The systems exchanged data perfectly because they both agreed that the price was a decimal with two fractions digits expressed in XML Schema and the message was sent via SOAP over HTTP (syntax)—standards used in the implementation of WS* web services—but they did not agree on whether the price included tax or not (semantics).
>
> 这是为什么标准不足的一个简单示例。 这些系统完美地交换了数据，因为它们都同意价格是XML Schema中表示的两位十进制的小数位数，并且消息是通过SOAP over HTTP（语法）通过SOAP发送的（WS* Web服务实现中使用的标准），但是他们确实在价格是否包含税（语义学）上没有达成一致。

> Of course, the only realistic approach to getting diverse applications to share information is by reaching agreements on the structure and function of the information to be shared. These agreements are often reflected in standards that provide a common interface that multiple vendors and application builders support. Standards have indeed been instrumental in achieving a significant level of interoperability that we rely on in almost every domain. However, while standards are useful and in many ways indispensable, expectations of what can be achieved through standards are unrealistic. Here are some of the challenges that organizations face related to standards and interoperability:
>
> 当然，使各种应用程序共享信息的唯一现实方法是就要共享的信息的结构和功能达成协议。 这些协议通常反映在提供多个供应商和应用程序构建者支持的通用接口的标准中。 标准确实在实现我们几乎在每个领域中都依赖的显着水平的互操作性方面发挥了作用。 然而，尽管标准是有用的并且在许多方面是必不可少的，但是对通过标准可以实现的目标的期望却是不现实的。 以下是组织面临的与标准和互操作性有关的一些挑战：
>
> 1. Ideally, every implementation of a standard should be identical and thus completely interoperable with any other implementation. However, this is far from reality. Standards, when incorporated into products, tools, and services, undergo customizations and extensions because every vendor wants to create a unique selling point as a competitive advantage.  
>
>   理想情况下，标准的每个实现都应该相同，因此可以与任何其他实现完全互操作。 但是，这远非现实。 当标准结合到产品，工具和服务中时，会进行自定义和扩展，因为每个供应商都希望创建一个独特的卖点作为竞争优势。
>
> 2. Standards are often deliberately open-ended and provide extension points. The actual implementation of these extension points is left to the discretion of implementers, leading to proprietary implementations.  
>
>   标准通常是故意开放式的，并提供扩展点。 这些扩展点的实际实现方式由实施者自行决定，以实现专有的实现。
>
> 3. Standards, like any technology, have a life cycle of their own and evolve over time in compatible and noncompatible ways. Deciding when to adopt a new or revised standard is a critical decision for organizations. Committing to a new standard that is not ready or eventually not adopted by the community is a big risk for organizations. On the other hand, waiting too long may also become a problem, which can lead to unsupported products, incompatibilities, and workarounds, because everyone else is using the standard.  
>
>   与任何技术一样，标准都有其自身的生命周期，并且会以兼容和不兼容的方式随时间而发展。 对于组织而言，决定何时采用新的或修订的标准是至关重要的决定。 承诺尚未准备好或最终未被社区采用的新标准对组织来说是很大的风险。 另一方面，等待时间过长也可能会成为问题，这可能会导致产品不受支持，不兼容和变通方法，因为其他所有人都在使用该标准。
>
> 4. Within the software community, there are as many bad standards as there are engineers with opinions. Bad standards include underspecified, overspecified, inconsistently specified, unstable, or irrelevant standards.  
>
>   在软件社区中，不良标准的数量与有意见的工程师一样多。 不良标准包括规格不足，规格过度，规格不一致，不稳定或不相关的标准。
>
> 5. It is quite common for standards to be championed by competing organizations, resulting in conflicting standards due to overlap or mutual exclusion.  
>
>   竞争组织拥护标准是很普遍的，由于重叠或相互排斥而导致标准冲突。
>
> 6. For new and rapidly emerging domains, the argument often made is that standardization will be destructive because it will hinder flexibility: premature standardization will force the use of an inadequate approach and lead to abandoning other presumably better approaches. So what do organizations do in the meantime?  
>
>   对于新兴领域和迅速崛起的领域，经常有人争辩说标准化会破坏性的，因为它会阻碍灵活性：过早的标准化将迫使使用不足的方法，并导致放弃其他可能更好的方法。 那么组织在此期间做什么呢？
>
> What these challenges illustrate is that because of the way in which standards are usually created and evolved, we cannot let standards drive our architectures. We need to architect systems first and then decide which standards can support desired system requirements and qualities. This approach allows standards to change and evolve without affecting the overall architecture of the system.
>
> 这些挑战说明，由于通常创建和发展标准的方式，我们不能让标准来驱动我们的体系结构。 我们需要先设计系统，然后再决定哪些标准可以支持所需的系统要求和质量。 这种方法允许标准在不影响系统整体体系结构的情况下进行更改和发展。
>
> I once heard someone in a keynote address say that “The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from.”
>
> 我曾经在主题演讲中听到有人说：“关于标准的好处是有很多选择。”

### 6.3 A Design Checklist for Interoperability 互操作性设计检查表

Table 6.3 is a checklist to support the design and analysis process for interoperability.

表6.3是支持互操作性设计和分析过程的清单。

**Table 6.3** Checklist to Support the Design and Analysis Process for Interoperability 支持互操作性设计和分析过程的清单

Category | Checklist
--|--
Allocation of Responsibilities | Determine which of your system responsibilities will need to interoperate with other systems.<br>Ensure that responsibilities have been allocated to detect a request to interoperate with known or unknown external systems.<br>Ensure that responsibilities have been allocated to carry out the following tasks:<br><li>Accept the request<br><li>Exchange information<br><li>Reject the request<br><li>Notify appropriate entities (people or systems)<br><li>Log the request (for interoperability in an untrusted environment, logging for nonrepudiation is essential)
Coordination Model | Ensure that the coordination mechanisms can meet the critical quality attribute requirements. Considerations for performance include the following:<br><li>Volume of traffic on the network both created by the systems under your control and generated by systems not under your control<br><li>Timeliness of the messages being sent by your systems<br><li>Currency of the messages being sent by your systems<br><li>Jitter of the messages’ arrival times<br><li>Ensure that all of the systems under your control make assumptions about protocols and underlying networks that are consistent with the systems not under your control.
Data Model | Determine the syntax and semantics of the major data abstractions that may be exchanged among interoperating systems.<br>Ensure that these major data abstractions are consistent with data from the interoperating systems. (If your system’s data model is confidential and must not be made public, you may have to apply transformations to and from the data abstractions of systems with which yours interoperates.)
Mapping among Architectural Elements | For interoperability, the critical mapping is that of components to processors. Beyond the necessity of making sure that components that communicate externally are hosted on processors that can reach the network, the primary considerations deal with meeting the security, availability, and performance requirements for the communication. These will be dealt with in their respective chapters.

Category | Checklist
--|--
Resource Management | Ensure that interoperation with another system (accepting a request and/or rejecting a request) can never exhaust critical system resources (e.g., can a flood of such requests cause service to be denied to legitimate users?).<br>Ensure that the resource load imposed by the communication requirements of interoperation is acceptable.<br>Ensure that if interoperation requires that resources be shared among the participating systems, an adequate arbitration policy is in place.
Binding Time | Determine the systems that may interoperate, and when they become known to each other. For each system over which you have control:<br><li>Ensure that it has a policy for dealing with binding to both known and unknown external systems.<br><li>Ensure that it has mechanisms in place to reject unacceptable bindings and to log such requests.<br><li>In the case of late binding, ensure that mechanisms will support the discovery of relevant new services or protocols, or the sending of information using chosen protocols.
Choice of Technology | For any of your chosen technologies, are they “visible” at the interface boundary of a system? If so, what interoperability effects do they have? Do they support, undercut, or have no effect on the interoperability scenarios that apply to your system? Ensure the effects they have are acceptable. Consider technologies that are designed to support interoperability, such as web services. Can they be used to satisfy the interoperability requirements for the systems under your control?

分类 | 检查表 Checklist

架构元素之间的映射 | 对于互操作性，关键的映射是组件到处理器的映射。 除了必须确保外部通信的组件托管在可以访问网络的处理器上之外，主要的考虑还包括满足通信的安全性，可用性和性能要求。 这些将在其各自的章节中进行处理。
资源管理 | 确保与另一个系统的互操作（接受请求和/或拒绝请求）永远不会耗尽关键的系统资源（例如，大量此类请求是否会导致拒绝合法用户使用服务？）。<br>确保该资源 互操作的通信要求所施加的负担是可以接受的。<br>请确保如果互操作要求参与系统之间共享资源，则适当的仲裁策略已经到位。

### 6.4 Summary 小结

Interoperability refers to the ability of systems to usefully exchange information. These systems may have been constructed with the intention of exchanging information, they may be existing systems that are desired to exchange information, or they may provide general services without knowing the details of the systems that wish to utilize those services.

The general scenario for interoperability provides the details of these different cases. In any interoperability case, the goal is to intentionally exchange information or reject the request to exchange information.

Achieving interoperability involves the relevant systems locating each other and then managing the interfaces so that they can exchange information.

### 6.5 F or Further Reading 进一步阅读

An SEI report gives a good overview of interoperability, and it highlights some of the “maturity frameworks” for interoperability [Brownsword 04].

The various WS* services are being developed under the auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and can be found at www.w3.org/2002/ws.

Systems of systems are of particular interest to the U.S. Department of Defense. An engineering guide can be found at [ODUSD 08].

### 6.6 Discussion Questions 问题讨论

1. Find a web service mashup. Write several concrete interoperability scenarios for this system.
2. What is the relationship between interoperability and the other quality attributes highlighted in this book? For example, if two systems fail to exchange information properly, could a security flaw result? What other quality attributes seem strongly related (at least potentially) to interoperability?
3. Is a service-oriented system a system of systems? If so, describe a service-oriented system that is directed, one that is acknowledged, one that is collaborative, and one that is virtual.
4. Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) was touted as a discovery service, but commercial support for UDDI is being withdrawn. Why do you suppose this is? Does it have anything to do with the quality attributes delivered or not delivered by UDDI solutions?
5. Why has the importance of orchestration grown in recent years?
6. If you are a technology producer, what are the advantages and disadvantages of adhering to interoperability standards? Why would a producer not adhere to a standard?
7. With what other systems will an automatic teller machine need to interoperate? How would you change your automatic teller system design to accommodate these other systems?

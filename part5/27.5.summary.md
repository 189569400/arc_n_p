An edge-dominant system is one that depends crucially on the inputs of users for its success. Users participate in information creation (“crowdsourcing”) and even its organization (“folksonomy”). These systems, part of the “Web 2.0” movement, are having profound social, political, and economic consequences.

All successful edge-dominant systems, and the organizations that develop and use these systems, share a common ecosystem structure known as the “Metropolis” structure. This structure shows how customers, end users, developers, and “prosumers” are related.

Edge systems bring a new life-cycle model to the fore, in which requirements are not completely known, software developed in planned increments is replaced by software that is constantly changing, and projects are staffed by members outside the purview of the central developing organization.

The dominant pattern for edge systems is the core/periphery pattern. This pattern divides the world into a closely controlled core and a loosely controlled periphery. To work, the core needs to be highly modular, highly reliable, and highly robust with respect to external faults. Cores are often designed as a set of services with well-documented APIs, discovery and registration, and sophisticated error detection and reporting.

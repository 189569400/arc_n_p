27.1 The Ecosystem of Edge-Dominant Systems
===

All successful edge-dominant systems, and the organizations that develop and use these systems, share a common ecosystem structure, as shown in Figure 27.1. This is called a “Metropolis” structure, by analogy with a city.

The Metropolis structure is not an architecture diagram: it is a representation of three communities of stakeholders:

![](fig.27.1)
FIGURE 27.1 The Metropolis structure of an edge-dominant system

* Customers and end users, who consume the value produced by the Metropolis
* Developers, who write software and key content for the Metropolis
* Prosumers, who consume content but also produce it

The Metropolis structure also presents three realms of roles and infrastructure:

* In the outermost ring reside the masses of end users of such systems. They contribute requirements but not content.
* The middle ring contains developers and prosumers. These are the stakeholders at the edge whose actions and whose value creation the organization would like to facilitate.
* All of this is held together by the core. The core is software; it provides its services through a set of APIs upon which the periphery can build. Linux’s kernel, Apache’s core, Wikipedia’s wiki, Facebook’s application platform, or the application platforms of the iPhone or Android.

In the Metropolis structure, the realms have different “permeability,” which the figure indicates by the dashed and solid lines.

In open source systems (such as Linux, MySQL, Apache, Eclipse, and Firefox), it is possible to move from the role of an end user to a developer to a core architect, by consistently contributing and moving up in the meritocracy. However, in open content systems (such as Wikipedia, Twitter, YouTube, Slashdot, and Facebook), nobody will invite you to become a software developer for the core, no matter how many cool movies or blog entries you contribute.

Thus, a key question for an organization wishing to foster edge-dominant systems: How should we architect the core and what development principles should we embrace for the periphery/edge?

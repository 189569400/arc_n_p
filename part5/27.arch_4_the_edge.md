27 Architecures for the Edge
===

_With Hong-Mei Chen_

_Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing._  
—John Stuart Mill

In this chapter we discuss the place of architecture in edge-dominant systems and discuss how an architect should approach building such systems. An edge-dominant system is one that depends crucially on the inputs of users for its success. What would Wikipedia be without the encyclopedic entries contributed by users? What would YouTube be without the contributed videos? What would Facebook and Twitter be without their user communities? YouTube serves up approximately 1 billion videos a day. Twitter boasts that its users tweet 50 million times per day. Facebook reports that it serves up about 30 billion pieces of content each month. Flickr recently announced that users had uploaded more than 6 billion photos. Strong, almost maniacal, user participation has elevated each of these sites from fairly routine repositories to forces that shape society.

在本章中，我们将讨论架构在边缘主导系统中的位置，并讨论架构师应如何构建此类系统。 边缘为主的系统是成功取决于用户输入的系统。 如果没有用户贡献的百科全书，维基百科将会是什么？ 如果没有用户提供的视频，YouTube将会是什么？ 如果没有用户社区，Facebook和Twitter将会是什么？ YouTube每天提供大约10亿个视频。 Twitter称其用户每天发5千万次推文。 Facebook报告说，它每月提供约300亿条内容。 Flickr最近宣布，用户上传了超过60亿张照片。 强烈的，几乎是疯狂的用户参与已将这些站点中的每一个从相当常规的存储库提升为塑造社会的力量。

In each case, the value of these systems comes almost entirely from its users — who happily contribute their opinions and knowledge, their artistic content, their software, and their innovations—and not from some centralized organization. This phenomenon is a cornerstone of the so-called “Web 2.0” movement. Darcy DiNucci, credited with coining the term, wrote in 1999, “The [new] Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens.” The “old” web was about going to web pages for static information; the “new” web is about participating in the information creation (“crowdsourcing”) and even becoming part of its organization (“folksonomy”).

在每种情况下，这些系统的价值几乎完全来自其用户（他们乐于贡献他们的见解和知识，他们的艺术内容，他们的软件和他们的创新），而不是来自某个集中化的组织。 这种现象是所谓的“Web 2.0”运动的基石。 达西·迪尼奇（Darcy DiNucci）曾以这个术语的创造而著称，他在1999年写道：“[新]网络将不被理解为文本和图形的筛选，而是被视为一种通过交互作用发生的以太的传输机制。”“旧”网络是关于 进入网页获取静态信息； “新”网站是关于参与信息创建（“众包”），甚至成为其组织的一部分（“民俗分类法”）。

Many have written about the social, political, and economic consequences of this change, and some see it as nothing short of a revolution along the lines of the industrial revolution. Yochai Benkler’s book The Wealth of Networks—a play on the title of Adam Smith’s classic book The Wealth of Nations, which heralded the start of the industrial revolution—argues that the “radical transformation” of how we create our information environment is restructuring society, particularly our models of production and consumption. Benkler calls this new economic model commons-based peer production. And it’s big: crowdsourced websites that are built on this model have become some of the dominant forces on the web and in society in the past few years. Populist revolutions are catalyzed by Twitter and Facebook. As of the time this book went to press, five of the top ten websites by traffic are peer produced: Facebook, YouTube, Blogger, Wikipedia, and Twitter. And the other five are portals or search engines that pore through the content created by billions of worldwide users. Websites that actually sell something from a centralized organization are rare in the world’s top sites; Amazon.com is the only example, and it’s no accident that it’s the bookseller that derives much of its popularity from the value created by customers.

许多人都写了这种变化的社会，政治和经济后果，有些人则认为这只是沿着工业革命路线的一场革命。 Yochai Benkler的《网络财富》一书以亚当·斯密（Adam Smith）的经典著作《国富论》（The Wealth of Nations）为标题，该书预示了工业革命的开始。该书认为，我们如何创建信息环境的“根本性变革”正在重塑社会，特别是我们的生产和消费模型。 Benkler称这种新的经济模式基于平民的同伴生产。而且意义重大：在过去几年中，基于此模型构建的众包网站已成为网络和社会上的主要力量。 Twitter和Facebook推动了民粹主义革命。在本书付印之时，按流量排名前十的网站中有五个是同行制作的：Facebook，YouTube，Blogger，Wikipedia和Twitter。另外五个是门户或搜索引擎，它们可以浏览数十亿全球用户创建的内容。实际上从集中化组织出售商品的网站在全球顶级网站中很少见； Amazon.com是唯一的例子，而书商从客户创造的价值中获得了极大的欢迎，这并非偶然。

Along with this paradigm shift, much of the world’s software is now open source. The two most popular web browsers in the world are open source (Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome). Apache is the most popular web server, currently powering almost two out of every three websites. Open source databases, IDEs, content management systems, and operating systems are all heavy hitters in their respective market spaces.

随着这种范式的转变，世界上许多软件现在都是开源的。 世界上两种最受欢迎的Web浏览器是开源的（Mozilla Firefox和Google Chrome）。 Apache是最受欢迎的Web服务器，目前每三个网站中的两个就支持。 开源数据库，IDE，内容管理系统和操作系统在各自的市场空间中都是沉重的打击者。

Why study this in a book about architecture? First, commons-based peer-produced systems are an excellent example of the architecture influence cycle. Second, the architecture of such systems has some important differences from the architectures that you would build for traditional systems. We start by examining how the forces of commons-based peer production change the very nature of the system’s development life cycle.

为什么在有关架构的书中对此进行研究？ 首先，基于公共资源的同伴生产系统是架构影响周期的一个很好的例子。 其次，此类系统的架构与您要为传统系统构建的架构有一些重要区别。 我们首先研究基于公共资源的同伴生产的力量如何改变系统开发生命周期的本质。

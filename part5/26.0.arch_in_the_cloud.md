26 Architecutre in the Cloud云上的架构

_There was a time when every household, town, farm or village had its own water well. Today, shared public utilities give us access to clean water by simply turning on the tap; cloud computing works in a similar fashion._  
—Vivek Kundra

If you have read anything about the history of computing, you will have read about time-sharing. This was the era, in the late 1960s and the 1970s, sandwiched between eras when individuals had sole, although limited, access to multimillion-dollar computers and when individuals had access to their own personal computers. Time-sharing involved multiple users (maybe as many as several hundred) simultaneously accessing a powerful mainframe computer through a terminal, potentially remote from the mainframe. The operating system on the mainframe made it appear as if each user had sole access to that computer except, possibly, for performance considerations. The driving force behind the development of time-sharing was economic; it was infeasible to provide every user with a multimillion-dollar computer, but efficiently sharing this expensive but powerful resource was the solution.

如果您已阅读有关计算历史的任何内容，则将阅读有关分时的信息。 这是一个时代，介于1960年代末期和1970年代，介于个人只能（尽管有限）访问数百万美元的计算机以及个人可以访问自己的个人计算机的时代之间。 分时涉及多个用户（可能多达数百个）同时通过终端（可能远离主机）访问功能强大的主机计算机。 大型机上的操作系统使它看起来好像每个用户都可以单独访问该计算机，但出于性能方面的考虑。 分时发展的推动力是经济。 为每个用户提供价值数百万美元的计算机是不可行的，但是有效地共享这种昂贵而强大的资源是解决方案。

In some ways, cloud computing is a re-creation of that era. In fact, some of the basic techniques—such as virtualization—that are used in the cloud today date from that period. Any user of an application in the cloud does not need to know that the application and the data it uses are situated several time zones away, and that thousands of other users are sharing it. Of course, with the advent of the Internet, the availability of much more powerful computers today, and the requirement for controlled sharing, designing the architecture for a cloud-based application is much different from designing the architecture for a time-sharing-based application. The driving forces, however, remain much the same. The economics of using the cloud as a deployment platform are so compelling that few organizations today can afford to ignore this set of technologies.

在某些方面，云计算是那个时代的再创造。 实际上，当今云中使用的一些基本技术（例如虚拟化）可追溯到该时期。 云中应用程序的任何用户都不需要知道该应用程序及其使用的数据位于几个时区之外，并且成千上万的其他用户正在共享它。 当然，随着Internet的出现，当今功能更强大的计算机的可用性以及对受控共享的要求，为基于云的应用程序设计体系结构与为基于分时的应用程序设计体系结构大不相同。但是，驱动力保持不变。 使用云作为部署平台的经济性如此诱人，以至于当今很少有组织能够负担得起忽略这套技术的费用。

In this chapter we introduce cloud concepts, and we discuss various service models and deployment options for the cloud, the economic justification for the cloud, the base architectures and mechanisms that make the cloud work, and some sample technologies. We will conclude by discussing how an architect should approach building a system in the cloud.

在本章中，我们将介绍云概念，并讨论云的各种服务模型和部署选项，云的经济理由，使云起作用的基本架构和机制以及一些示例技术。 我们将通过讨论架构师应该如何在云中构建系统来结束。

The cloud has become a viable alternative for the hosting of data centers primarily for economic reasons. It provides an elastic set of resources through the use of virtual machines, virtual networks, and virtual file systems.

The cloud can be used to provide infrastructure, platforms, or services. Each of these has its own characteristics.

NoSQL database systems arose in reaction to the overhead introduced by large relational database management systems. NoSQL database systems frequently use a data model based on key-value or documents and do not provide support for common database services such as transactions.

Architecting in the cloud means that the architect should pay attention to specific aspects of quality attributes that are substantially different in cloud environments, namely: performance, availability, and security.

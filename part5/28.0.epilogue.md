Fine. Now what?
好。 怎么办？

It's very tempting to end the book with a cheery imperative to go forth and architect great systems. But the truth is, life isn't that simple.

用一本令人振奋的命令来结束本书并设计出色的系统是非常诱人的。 但事实是，生活并非如此简单。

The authors of this book have, collectively, an embarrassingly large number of years of experience in teaching software architecture. We teach it through books like this one, in the classroom to students, and in industrial short courses to practicing software architects of all stripes, from “aspiring” to “old hand.” And often, much too often, we know that after our students conscientiously learn what we have to offer, they walk into an organization that is not as architecturally savvy as the students now are, and our students have no practical way to put what they have learned into practice.

本书的作者共同在软件架构教学方面拥有大量令人尴尬的多年经验。 我们在教室里为学生提供此类书籍，从工业短期课程到从“有抱负”到“老手”的各行各业的软件架构师，我们都通过这种方式教书。而且，我们经常知道， 学生会认真学习我们所提供的知识，他们走进的组织在架构上不像现在的学生那么精明，而且我们的学生没有实践的方法将所学知识付诸实践。

Most of you will not be able to dictate an architecture-based philosophy to the projects to which you’ll be assigned, if it’s not already present. You won’t be able to say, “This Agile project needs a lead software architect!” and make it stick if the team leaders think that Agile methods won’t permit any overarching design. You won’t be able to say, “We’re going to include an explicit architecture evaluation in our project schedule” and have everyone comply. You won’t be able to say, “We’re going to use the Views and Beyond approach and templates for our architecture documentation” and have your directive obeyed.

如果您尚不存在，大多数人将无法为要分配给您的项目指定基于架构的哲学。 您将无法说“这个敏捷项目需要首席软件架构师！”，如果团队负责人认为敏捷方法不允许任何总体设计，那么它就会坚持下去。 您将不会说：“我们将在项目进度表中包括明确的架构评估”，并且每个人都遵守。 您将不会说：“我们将使用Views and Beyond方法和模板作为我们的体系结构文档”，并遵守您的指示。

Lest you feel that all your time absorbing the material in this book was time spent for a lost cause, we want to close the book with some advice for carrying what you’ve learned into your professional setting:

为了避免您将所有时间都花在吸收本书上的时间上是浪费在迷茫的事业上，我们希望在本书结尾时提供一些建议，以将您所学的知识带入专业领域：

1. Speak the right language. You know by now that architecture is the means to an end, and not an end in itself. The decision makers in your organization typically care about the ends, not the means. They care about products, not the architectures of those products. They care about ensuring that the products are competitive in the marketplace. And they care about executing the organization’s marketing and business strategy. They may not express their concerns in architecturally significant terms, but rather in market terms that you’ll have to translate.  
说正确的语言。 您现在知道架构是达到目的的手段，而不是目的本身。 您组织中的决策者通常关心目标，而不是手段。 他们关心的是产品，而不是那些产品的架构。 他们关心确保产品在市场上具有竞争力。 并且他们关心执行组织的营销和业务策略。 他们可能不会以结构上重要的术语来表达他们的担忧，而是以您必须翻译的市场术语来表达。
2. Speak the right language, part 2. Project managers care about reduction of technical risk, reliable and realistic scheduling and budgeting, and planning the production of those products. To the extent that you can justify a focus on architecture in those terms, you’ll more likely be successful in gaining the freedom to carry out some of the practices espoused in this book. And you really can justify this focus: A sound architecture is an unparalleled risk reduction strategy, a reliable work estimator, and a good predictor of production methods.  
说正确的语言，第2部分。项目经理关心降低技术风险，可靠和切合实际的日程安排和预算，以及计划这些产品的生产。 在某种程度上，您可以证明专注于这些架构是合理的，那么您更有可能成功地获得执行本书中所倡导的一些实践的自由。 您确实可以证明这一关注点是正确的：健全的架构是无与伦比的降低风险策略，可靠的工作估算器和生产方法的良好预测器。
3. Get involved. One of the best ways to insert architectural concerns into a project is to show its value to stakeholders who don’t often get a chance to see it. Requirements engineers are a case in point. Most often, they meet with customers and users, capture their concerns, write them up, and toss the requirements over the fence (usually a very tall fence) to the designers. Challenge this segregation! Try to get involved in the requirements capture activity. Invite yourself to meetings. Say that, as an architect, you want to understand the problem by hearing the concerns straight from the horse’s mouth. This will give you critical exposure to the very stakeholders you’ll need to help with your design, evaluation, and documentation chores. Furthermore it will give you a chance to add value to the requirements capture process. Because you may have a design approach in mind, you may be able to offer better quality attribute responses than the customer has in mind, and that might make our marketers very happy. Or you may be able to spot troublesome requirements early on, and help nudge the customer to a perfectly adequate but more architecturally palatable QA response. Also, you can take it upon yourself to contact your organization’s marketers. They are often the ones who come up with product concepts. You would do well to learn how they do that, and eventually you could help them by pointing out useful variations on existing products that could use the same architecture.  
参与进来。将架构问题插入项目的最好方法之一是向没有机会看到它的利益相关者展示其价值。需求工程师就是一个很好的例子。通常，他们会与客户和用户会面，捕捉他们的疑虑，将其写下来，然后将要求从围栏（通常是很高的围栏）上扔给设计师。挑战这种种族隔离！尝试参与需求捕获活动。邀请自己参加会议。假设作为架构师，您想通过直接从马口中听到问题来理解问题。这将使您与需要帮助设计，评估和处理文档的非常重要的利益相关者接触。此外，这将使您有机会为需求捕获过程增加价值。因为您可能会考虑一种设计方法，所以您可能会提供比客户所想的更好的质量属性响应，这可能会使我们的营销人员感到非常满意。或者，您也许能够及早发现麻烦的需求，并帮助推动客户做出完全适当但在架构上更可口的质量检查响应。另外，您可以自己联系组织的营销人员。他们通常是提出产品概念的人。您最好了解他们如何做到这一点，最终您可以指出可能使用相同架构的现有产品的有用变化，从而为他们提供帮助。
4. It’s the economy, stupid. Think in, and couch your arguments in, economic terms. If you think an architectural trade study, or an architecture document, or an architecture evaluation, or ensuring code compliance with the architecture is a good idea for your project, make a business case for it. Pointy-haired bosses in comic strips notwithstanding, managers are really—trust us here—rational people. But their goals are broad and almost always have to do with economics. You should be able to argue, using back-of-the-envelope arithmetic, that (for example) producing an updated version of the architecture document is a worthwhile activity when the system undergoes a major change. You should be able to argue that activities undertaken with the new architecture documentation will be much less error-prone (and therefore less expensive) than those same activities undertaken without a guiding architecture. And the effort to keep the documentation up to date is much less than the expected savings. You can plug some numbers in a spreadsheet to make this argument. The numbers don’t have to be accurate, just reasonable, and they’ll still make your case.  
这是经济，愚蠢的。思考并以经济术语表达您的观点。如果您认为架构贸易研究，架构文档或架构评估，或确保代码与架构相符是您的项目的好主意，请为其提出业务案例。尽管有漫画中尖尖的老板，但经理们确实是（在这里相信我们）理性的人。但是他们的目标很广泛，几乎总是与经济学有关。您应该能够辩解道理，例如，当系统进行重大更改时，生成架构文档的更新版本是值得的（例如）。您应该能够辩称，与没有指导性架构的情况下进行的那些相同活动相比，使用新架构文档进行的活动将更少出错（因此成本更低）。保持文档更新的工作量远远少于预期的节省量。您可以在电子表格中插入一些数字作为此参数。这些数字不一定是准确的，只是合理的，它们仍然可以证明您的情况。
5. Start a guerrilla movement. Find like-minded people in your organization and nurture their interest in architecture. Start a brown-bag lunchtime reading and discussion group that covers books or book chapters or papers or even blogs about architecture. For example, your group could read the chapter in this book about architecture competence, and discuss what practices you’d like to see your organization adopt, and what it would take to adopt them. Or the group could agree on a joint documentation template for architecture, or come up with a set of quality attribute scenarios that apply across your collective projects. Especially appealing is to come up with a set of patterns that apply to the systems you’re building. Or bring a vexing design problem from your individual project, and let the group work on a written solution to it. Or have the group offer its services as a roving architecture evaluation team to other projects. Your group should meet regularly and often, and adopt a specific set of tangible goals. The importance of an enthusiastic and dedicated leader—you?—who is keen to mature the organization’s architecture practices cannot be overstated. Advertise your meetings, advertise your results, and keep asking more members to join your group.  
开始游击运动。在您的组织中找到志趣相投的人，并培养他们对架构的兴趣。开始一个自带的午餐时间阅读和讨论小组，讨论小组讨论书籍，书籍章节或论文，甚至有关架构的博客。例如，您的小组可以阅读本书中有关架构能力的一章，并讨论您希望组织采用哪些实践以及采用这些实践需要采取什么措施。或者，小组可以就架构的联合文档模板达成一致，或者提出适用于您的集体项目的一组质量属性方案。尤其吸引人的是提出一套适用于您正在构建的系统的模式。或从您的单个项目中提出一个令人烦恼的设计问题，然后让小组为之编写书面解决方案。或者让该小组作为其他项目的巡回架构评估团队提供服务。您的小组应定期定期召开会议，并采取一系列具体的具体目标。热心且敬业的领导者（您呢？）的重要性是谁，他们渴望成熟于组织的架构实践，所以不要夸大其词。宣传您的会议，宣传您的结果，并不断要求更多成员加入您的论坛。
6. Relish small victories. You don’t have to change the world overnight. Every improvement you make will put you and your organization in a better place than it would have been otherwise.  
享受小胜利。您不必一夜之间改变世界。您所做的每一项改进都会使您和您的组织处在比以前更好的地方。

> If you search the web for “code review computer science,” you’ll turn up millions of hits that describe code reviews and the steps that are taken to perform them. If you search for “design review computer science,” you’ll turn up little that is useful.

> 如果您在网络上搜索“代码审查计算机科学”，则会发现数百万次匹配，它们描述了代码审查以及执行代码审查的步骤。 如果您搜索“设计评论计算机科学”，那么您会发现有用的内容很少。

> Other disciplines routinely practice and teach design critiques. Search for “design critique” and you will find many hits together with instructions. A design is a set of decisions of whatever type that attempts to solve a particular problem, whether an art problem, a user interface design problem, or a software problem. Solutions to important design problems should be subject to peer review, just as code should be subject to peer review.

> 其他学科通常会练习和教授设计评论。 搜索“设计评论”，您会发现许多热门歌曲以及相关说明。 设计是试图解决特定问题（无论是美术问题，用户界面设计问题还是软件问题）的任何类型的决策集。 重要的设计问题的解决方案应经过同行评审，就像代码应经过同行评审一样。

> There is a wealth of data that points out that the earlier in the life cycle a problem is discovered and fixed, the less the cost of finding and fixing the problem. Design precedes code and so having appropriate design reviews seems both intuitively and empirically justified. In addition, the documents around the review, both the original design document and also the critiques, are valuable learning tools for new developers. In many organizations developers switch systems frequently, and so they are constantly learning.

> 大量数据指出，在生命周期中越早发现并解决问题，发现和解决问题的成本就越低。 设计先于代码，因此进行适当的设计审查似乎在直观和经验上都是合理的。 此外，围绕评估的文档（包括原始设计文档和评论）对于新开发人员而言都是宝贵的学习工具。 在许多组织中，开发人员经常切换系统，因此他们不断学习。
>
> This view is not universally shared. A software engineer working in a major software house tells me that even though the organization aspires to writing and reviewing design documents, it rarely happens. Senior developers tend to limit their review to a cursory glance. Code reviews, on the other hand, are taken quite seriously by the senior developers. My software engineer friend offers two possible explanations for this state of affairs:

> 这种观点并未得到普遍认同。 一家大型软件公司的软件工程师告诉我，即使该组织渴望编写和审阅设计文档，也很少发生。 高级开发人员倾向于将他们的评论限制在粗略的范围内。 另一方面，高级开发人员非常重视代码审查。 我的软件工程师朋友针对这种情况提供了两种可能的解释：
>
> 1. The code review is the last opportunity to affect what is built: “review this or live with it.” This explanation assumes that senior developers do not believe that the output of design reviews are actionable and thus wait to engage until later in the process.  
> 1.代码评审是影响构建内容的最后机会：“对其进行审查或与之一起使用。”这种解释假定高级开发人员不相信设计审查的输出是可操作的，因此要等到以后再参与。 过程。
> 2. The code is more concrete than the design, and is therefore easier to assess. This explanation assumes that senior developers are incapable of understanding designs.  
> 2.代码比设计更具体，因此更易于评估。 此说明假定高级开发人员无法理解设计。
>
> I do not find either of these explanations compelling, but I am unable to come up with a better one.
>
> 我认为这两种解释都不具有说服力，但我无法提出更好的解释。
>
> What to do?
>
> 怎么办？
>
> What this software engineer did is to look for a surrogate process where a design review could be surreptitiously performed. This individual noticed that when the organization did code reviews, questions such as “Why did you do that?” were frequently asked. The result of such questions was a discussion of rationale. So the individual would code up a solution to a problem, submit it to a code review, and wait for the question that would lead to the rationale discussion.
>
> 该软件工程师所做的是寻找可以秘密执行设计审查的替代流程。 该个人注意到，当组织进行代码审查时，经常会问诸如“您为什么这样做？”之类的问题。 这些问题的结果是对基本原理的讨论。 因此，个人将为问题编写解决方案，将其提交给代码审查，然后等待将导致基本原理讨论的问题。
>
> A design review is a review where design decisions are presented together with their rationale. Frequently, design alternatives are explored. Whether this is done under the name of code review or design review is not nearly as important as getting it done.
>
> 设计评审是对设计决策及其基本原理进行介绍的评审。 通常，会探索设计替代方案。 是以代码审查还是设计审查的名义完成此任务，并不比完成任务重要。
>
> Of course, my friend’s surreptitious approach has drawbacks. It is inefficient to code a solution that may have to be thrown away. Also, embedding design reviews into code reviews means that the designs and reviews end up being embedded in the code review tool, making it difficult to search this tool for design and design rationale. But these inefficiencies are dwarfed by the inefficiency of pursuing an incorrect solution to a particular problem.
>
> 当然，我朋友的秘密方法有缺点。 编写可能不得不扔掉的解决方案效率很低。 此外，将设计评论嵌入代码审查意味着最终将设计和审查嵌入代码审查工具中，从而很难在该工具中搜索设计和设计依据。 但是，这些低效率与为特定问题寻求错误解决方案的低效率相形见绌。

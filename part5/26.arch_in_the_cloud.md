26 Architecutre in the Cloud

_There was a time when every household, town, farm
or village had its own water well. Today, shared public
utilities give us access to clean water by simply turning
on the tap; cloud computing works in a similar fashion._  
—Vivek Kundra

If you have read anything about the history of computing, you will have read about time-sharing. This was the era, in the late 1960s and the 1970s, sandwiched between eras when individuals had sole, although limited, access to multimillion-dollar computers and when individuals had access to their own personal computers. Time-sharing involved multiple users (maybe as many as several hundred) simultaneously accessing a powerful mainframe computer through a terminal, potentially remote from the mainframe. The operating system on the mainframe made it appear as if each user had sole access to that computer except, possibly, for performance considerations. The driving force behind the development of time-sharing was economic; it was infeasible to provide every user with a multimillion-dollar computer, but efficiently sharing this expensive but powerful resource was the solution.

In some ways, cloud computing is a re-creation of that era. In fact, some of the basic techniques—such as virtualization—that are used in the cloud today date from that period. Any user of an application in the cloud does not need to know that the application and the data it uses are situated several time zones away, and that thousands of other users are sharing it. Of course, with the advent of the Internet, the availability of much more powerful computers today, and the requirement for controlled sharing, designing the architecture for a cloud-based application is much different from designing the architecture for a time-sharing-based application. The driving forces, however, remain much the same. The economics of using the cloud as a deployment platform are so compelling that few organizations today can afford to ignore this set of technologies.

In this chapter we introduce cloud concepts, and we discuss various service models and deployment options for the cloud, the economic justification for the cloud, the base architectures and mechanisms that make the cloud work, and some sample technologies. We will conclude by discussing how an architect should approach building a system in the cloud.

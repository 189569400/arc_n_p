This cata-log is not meant to be exhaustive&#x2014;in fact no such catalog is possible. Rather it is meant to be representative. We show patterns of runtime elements (such as broker or client-server) and of design-time elements (such as layers). For each pattern we list the context, problem, and solution. As part of the solution, we briefly de-scribe the elements, relations, and constraints of each pattern.</p><p>Applying a pattern is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Pattern definitions given in catalogs are strict, but in practice architects may choose to violate them in small ways when there is a good design tradeoff to be had (sacrificing a little of whatever the violation cost, but gaining something that the deviation gained). For example, the layered pattern expressly forbids software in lower layers from using software in upper layers, but there may be cases (such as to gain some per-formance) when an architecture might allow a few specific exceptions.</p><p>Patterns can be categorized by the dominant type of elements that they show: module patterns show modules, component-and-connector (C&amp;C) patterns show components and connectors, and allocation patterns show a combination of software elements (modules, components, connectors) and nonsoftware ele-ments. Most published patterns are C&amp;C patterns, but there are module patterns and allocation patterns as well. We&#x2019;ll begin with the granddaddy of module pat-terns, the layered pattern.</p><h2 id="module-patterns"><a name="module-patterns" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#module-patterns"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Module Patterns</h2><h3 id="layered-pattern"><a name="layered-pattern" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#layered-pattern"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Layered Pattern</h3><p><strong>Context</strong>: All complex systems experience the need to develop and evolve por-tions of the system independently. For this reason the developers of the system need a clear and well-documented separation of concerns, so that modules of the system may be independently developed and maintained.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: The software needs to be segmented in such a way that the modules can be developed and evolved separately with little interaction among the parts, supporting portability, modifiability, and reuse.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: To achieve this separation of concerns, the layered pattern divides the software into units called layers. Each layer is a grouping of modules that offers a cohesive set of services. There are constraints on the allowed-to-use relationship among the layers: the relations must be unidirectional. Layers completely parti-tion a set of software, and each partition is exposed through a public interface. The layers are created to interact according to a strict ordering relation. If (A,B) is in this relation, we say that the implementation of layer A is allowed to use any of the public facilities provided by layer B. In some cases, modules in one layer might be required to directly use modules in a nonadjacent lower layer; normally only next-lower-layer uses are allowed. This case of software in a higher layer using modules in a nonadjacent lower layer is called layer bridging. If many in-stances of layer bridging occur, the system may not meet its portability and modi-fiability goals that strict layering helps to achieve. Upward usages are not allowed in this pattern.</p><p>Of course, none of this comes for free. Someone must design and build the layers, which can often add up-front cost and complexity to a system. Also, if the layering is not designed correctly, it may actually get in the way, by not provid-ing the lower-level abstractions that programmers at the higher levels need. And layering always adds a performance penalty to a system. If a call is made to a function in the top-most layer, this may have to traverse many lower layers before being executed by the hardware. Each of these layers adds some overhead of their own, at minimum in the form of context switching.</p><p>Table 13.1 summarizes the solution of the layered pattern.

---|---
Overview | The layered pattern defines layers (groupings of modules that offer a cohesive set of services) and a unidirectional allowed-to-use relation among the layers. The pattern is usually shown graphically by stacking boxes representing layers on top of each other.
Elements | Layer, a kind of module. The description of a layer should define what modules the layer contains and a characterization of the cohesive set of services that the layer provides.
Relations | Allowed to use, which is a specialization of a more generic depends-on relation. The design should define what the layer usage rules are (e.g., &#x201C;a layer is allowed to use any lower layer&#x201D; or &#x201C;a layer is allowed to use only the layer immediately below it&#x201D;) and any allowable exceptions.
Constraints | <li> Every piece of software is allocated to exactly one layer. <br></li><li> There are at least two layers (but usually there are three or more). <br></li><li> The allowed-to-use relations should not be circular (i.e., a lower layer cannot use a layer above).
Weaknesses | </li><li> The addition of layers adds up-front cost and complexity to a system. <br></li><li> Layers contribute a performance penalty.</li></p><blockquote><p><strong>Some Finer Points of Layers</strong></p><p>A layered architecture is one of the few places where connections among components can be shown by adjacency, and where &#x201C;above&#x201D; and &#x201C;below&#x201D; matter. If you turn Figure 13.1 upside-down so that C is on top, this would represent a completely different design. Diagrams that use arrows among the boxes to denote relations retain their semantic meaning no matter the orientation.</p><p>The layered pattern is one of the most commonly used patterns in all of software engineering, but I&#x2019;m often surprised by how many people still get it wrong.</p><p>First, it is impossible to look at a stack of boxes and tell whether layer bridging is allowed or not. That is, can a layer use any lower layer, or just the next lower one? It is the easiest thing in the world to resolve this; all the architect has to do is include the answer in the key to the diagram&#x2019;s nota-tion (something we recommend for all diagrams). For example, consider the layered pattern presented in Figure 13.2 on the next page.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m still surprised at how few architects actually bother to do this. And if they don&#x2019;t, their layer diagrams are ambiguous.</p><p>Second, any old set of boxes stacked on top of each other does not constitute a layered architecture. For instance, look at the design shown in Figure 13.3, which uses arrows instead of adjacency to indicate the relationships among the boxes. Here, everything is allowed to use every-thing. This is decidedly not a layered architecture. The reason is that if Layer A is replaced by a different version, Layer C (which uses it in this fig-ure) might well have to change. We don&#x2019;t want our virtual machine layer to change every time our application layer changes. But I&#x2019;m still surprised at how many people call a stack of boxes lined up with each other &#x201C;layers&#x201D; (or think that layers are the same as tiers in a multi-tier architecture).</p><p><img alt="" src="fig.13.2">
FIGURE 13.2 A simple layer diagram, with a simple key answering the uses question</p><p><img alt="" src="fig.13.">
FIGURE 13.3 A wolf in layer&#x2019;s clothing</p><p>Third, many architectures that purport to be layered look something like Figure 13.4. This diagram probably means that modules in A, B, or C can use modules in D, but without a key to tell us for sure, it could mean anything. &#x201C;Sidecars&#x201D; like this often contain common utilities (sometimes imported), such as error handlers, communication protocols, or database access mechanisms. This kind of diagram makes sense only in the case where no layer bridging is allowed in the main stack. Otherwise, D could simply be made the bottom-most layer in the main stack, and the &#x201C;sidecar&#x201D; geometry would be unnecessary. But I&#x2019;m still surprised at how often I see this layout go unexplained.</p><p>Sometimes layers are divided into segments denoting a finer-grained decomposition of the modules. Sometimes this occurs when a preexisting set of units, such as imported modules, share the same allowed-to-use relation. When this happens, you have to specify what usage rules are in effect among the segments. Many usage rules are possible, but they must be made explicit. In Figure 13.5, the top and the bottom layers are</p><p><img alt="" src="fig.13.4">
FIGURE 13.4 Layers with a &#x201C;sidecar&#x201D;</p><p><img alt="" src="fig.13.5">
FIGURE 13.5 Layered design with segmented layers</p><p>segmented. Segments of the top layer are not allowed to use each other, but segments of the bottom layer are. If you draw the same diagram with-out the arrows, it will be harder to differentiate the different usage rules within segmented layers. Layered diagrams are often a source of hidden ambiguity because the diagram does not make explicit the allowed-to-use relations.</p><p>Finally, the most important point about layering is that a layer isn&#x2019;t allowed to use any layer above it. A module &#x201C;uses&#x201D; another module when it depends on the answer it gets back. But a layer is allowed to make upward calls, as long as it isn&#x2019;t expecting an answer from them. This is how the common error-handling scheme of callbacks works. A program in layer A calls a program in a lower layer B, and the parameters include a pointer to an error-handling program in A that the lower layer should call in case of error. The software in B makes the call to the program in A, but cares not in the least what it does. By not depending in any way on the contents of A, B is insulated from changes in A.</p><p>&#x2014;PCC</p></blockquote><h2 id="other-module-patterns"><a name="other-module-patterns" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#other-module-patterns"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Other Module Patterns</h2><p>Designers in a particular domain often publish &#x201C;standard&#x201D; module decomposi-tions for systems in that domain.

When a client needs a service, it queries a broker via a service interface. The broker then for-wards the client&#x2019;s service request to a server, which processes the request. The ser-vice result is communicated from the server back to the broker, which then returns the result (and any exceptions) back to the requesting client. In this way the client remains completely ignorant of the identity, location, and characteristics of the server. Because of this separation, if a server becomes unavailable, a replacement can be dynamically chosen by the broker. If a server is replaced with a different (compatible) service, again, the broker is the only component that needs to know of this change, and so the client is unaffected. Proxies are commonly introduced as intermediaries in addition to the broker to help with details of the interaction with the broker, such as marshaling and unmarshaling messages.</p><p>The down sides of brokers are that they add complexity (brokers and possibly proxies must be designed and implemented, along with messaging protocols) and add a level of indirection between a client and a server, which will add latency to their communication. Debugging brokers can be difficult because they are involved in highly dynamic environments where the conditions leading to a failure may be difficult to replicate. The broker would be an obvious point of attack, from a security perspective, and so it needs to be hardened appropriately. Also a broker, if it is not designed carefully, can be a single point of failure for a large and complex system. And brokers can potentially be bottlenecks for communication.</p><p>Table 13.2 summarizes the solution of the broker pattern.</p><p>TABLE 13.2 Broker Pattern Solution

---|---
Overview | The broker pattern defines a runtime component, called a broker, that mediates the communication between a number of clients and servers.
Elements | <em>Client</em>, a requester of services <br><em>Server</em>, a provider of services <br><em>Broker</em>, an intermediary that locates an appropriate server to fulfill a client&#x2019;s request, forwards the request to the server, and returns the results to the client <br><em>Client-side proxy</em>, an intermediary that manages the actual communication with the broker, including marshaling, sending, and unmarshaling of messages <br><em>Server-side proxy</em>, an intermediary that manages the actual communication with the broker, including marshaling, sending, and unmarshaling of messages
Relations | The attachment relation associates clients (and, optionally, client-side proxies) and servers (and, optionally, server-side proxies) with brokers.
Constraints | The client can only attach to a broker (potentially via a client-side proxy). The server can only attach to a broker (potentially via a server-side proxy).
Weaknesses | Brokers add a layer of indirection, and hence latency, between clients and servers, and that layer may be a communication bottleneck. <br>The broker can be a single point of failure. <br>A broker adds up-front complexity. <br>A broker may be a target for security attacks. <br>A broker may be difficult to test.</p><p>The broker is, of course, the critical component in this pattern. The pattern provides all of the modifiability benefits of the use-an-intermediary tactic (described in Chapter 7), an availability benefit (because the broker pattern makes it easy to replace a failed server with another), and a performance benefit (because the broker pattern makes it easy to assign work to the least-busy server). However, the pattern also carries with it some liabilities. For example, the use of a broker precludes performance optimizations that you might make if you knew the precise location and characteristics of the server. Also the use of this pattern adds the overhead of the intermediary and thus latency.</p><p>The original version of the broker pattern, as documented by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides [Gamma 94], is given in Figure 13.6.</p><p>The first widely used implementation of the broker pattern was in the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). Other common uses of this pattern are found in Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) and Microsoft&#x2019;s .NET platform&#x2014;essentially any modern platform for distributed service providers and consumers implements some form of a broker. The service-oriented architecture (SOA) approach depends crucially on brokers, most commonly in the form of an enterprise service bus.</p><h3 id="model-view-controller-pattern"><a name="model-view-controller-pattern" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#model-view-controller-pattern"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Model-View-Controller Pattern</h3><p><strong>Context</strong>: User interface software is typically the most frequently modified portion of an interactive application.

FIGURE 13.6 The broker pattern</p><p>to the user interface software separate from the rest of the system. Users often wish to look at data from different perspectives, such as a bar graph or a pie chart. These representations should both reflect the current state of the data.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: How can user interface functionality be kept separate from application functionality and yet still be responsive to user input, or to changes in the under-lying application&#x2019;s data? And how can multiple views of the user interface be cre-ated, maintained, and coordinated when the underlying application data changes?</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: The model-view-controller (MVC) pattern separates application func-tionality into three kinds of components:</p><ul><li>A <em>model</em>, which contains the application&#x2019;s data
</li>
<li>A <em>view</em>, which displays some portion of the underlying data and interacts with the user
</li>
<li>A <em>controller</em>, which mediates between the model and the view and manages
the notifications of state changes
</li></ul>
<p>MVC is not appropriate for every situation. The design and implementation of three distinct kinds of components, along with their various forms of interaction, may be costly, and this cost may not make sense for relatively simple user interfaces. Also, the match between the abstractions of MVC and commercial user interface toolkits is not perfect. The view and the controller split apart input and output, but these functions are often combined into individual widgets. This may result in a conceptual mismatch between the architecture and the user interface toolkit.</p><p>Table 13.3 summarizes the solution of the MVC pattern.</p><p>TABLE 13.3 Model-View-Controller Pattern Solution
-|-
---|---
Overview | The MVC pattern breaks system functionality into three components: a model, a view, and a controller that mediates between the model and the view.
Elements | The <em>model</em> is a representation of the application data or state, and it contains (or provides an interface to) application logic. <br>The <em>view</em> is a user interface component that either produces a representation of the model for the user or allows for some form of user input, or both. <br>The <em>controller</em> manages the interaction between the model and the view, translating user actions into changes to the model or changes to the view.
Relations | The <em>notifies</em> relation connects instances of model, view, and controller, notifying elements of relevant state changes.
Constraints | There must be at least one instance each of model, view, and controller. <br>The model component should not interact directly with the controller.
Weaknesses | The complexity may not be worth it for simple user interfaces. <br>The model, view, and controller abstractions may not be good fits for some user interface toolkits.</p><p>There may, in fact, be many views and many controllers associated with a model. For example, a set of business data may be represented as columns of numbers in a spreadsheet, as a scatter plot, or as a pie chart. Each of these is a separate view, and this view can be dynamically updated as the model changes (for example, showing live transactions in a transaction processing system). A model may be updated by different controllers; for example, a map could be zoomed and panned via mouse movements, trackball movements, keyboard clicks, or voice commands; each of these different forms of input needs to be managed by a controller.</p><p>The MVC components are connected to each other via some flavor of notification, such as events or callbacks. These notifications contain state updates. A change in the model needs to be communicated to the views so that they may be updated. An external event, such as a user input, needs to be communicated to the controller, which may in turn update the view and/or the model. Notifications may be either push or pull.</p><p>Because these components are loosely coupled, it is easy to develop and test them in parallel, and changes to one have minimal impact on the others. The relationships between the components of MVC are shown in Figure 13.7.</p><p><img alt="" src="fig.13.7">
FIGURE 13.7 The model-view-controller pattern</p><p>The MVC pattern is widely used in user interface libraries such as Java&#x2019;s Swing classes, Microsoft&#x2019;s ASP.NET framework, Adobe&#x2019;s Flex software development kit, Nokia&#x2019;s Qt framework, and many others. As such, it is common for a single application to contain many instances of MVC (often one per user interface object).</p><h3 id="pipe-and-filter-pattern"><a name="pipe-and-filter-pattern" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#pipe-and-filter-pattern"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Pipe-and-Filter Pattern</h3><p><strong>Context</strong>: Many systems are required to transform streams of discrete data items, from input to output. Many types of transformations occur repeatedly in practice, and so it is desirable to create these as independent, reusable parts.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Such systems need to be divided into reusable, loosely coupled com-ponents with simple, generic interaction mechanisms. In this way they can be flexibly combined with each other. The components, being generic and loosely coupled, are easily reused. The components, being independent, can execute in parallel.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: The pattern of interaction in the pipe-and-filter pattern is characterized by successive transformations of streams of data. Data arrives at a filter&#x2019;s input port(s), is transformed, and then is passed via its output port(s) through a pipe to the next filter. A single filter can consume data from, or produce data to, one or more ports.</p><p>There are several weaknesses associated with the pipe-and-filter pattern. For instance, this pattern is typically not a good choice for an interactive system, as it disallows cycles (which are important for user feedback). Also, having large numbers of independent filters can add substantial amounts of computational overhead, because each filter runs as its own thread or process. Also, pipe-and-filter systems may not be appropriate for long-running computations, without the addition of some form of checkpoint/restore functionality, as the failure of any filter (or pipe) can cause the entire pipeline to fail.</p><p>The solution of the pipe-and-filter pattern is summarized in Table 13.4.</p><p>Pipes buffer data during communication. Because of this property, filters can execute asynchronously and concurrently. Moreover, a filter typically does not know the identity of its upstream or downstream filters. For this reason, pipeline pipe-and-filter systems have the property that the overall computation can be treated as the functional composition of the computations of the filters, making it easier for the architect to reason about end-to-end behavior.</p><p>Data transformation systems are typically structured as pipes and filters, with each filter responsible for one part of the overall transformation of the input data. The independent processing at each step supports reuse, parallelization, and simplified reasoning about overall behavior. Often such systems constitute the front end of signal-processing applications. These systems receive sensor data at a set of initial filters; each of these filters compresses the data and performs initial processing (such as smoothing). Downstream filters reduce the data further and do synthesis across data derived from different sensors. The final filter typically passes its data to an application, for example providing input to modeling or visualization tools.</p><p>Other systems that use pipe-and-filter include those built using UNIX pipes, the request processing architecture of the Apache web server, the map-reduce pattern (presented later in this chapter), Yahoo! Pipes for processing RSS feeds, many workflow engines, and many scientific computation systems that have to process and analyze large streams of captured data. Figure 13.8 shows a UML diagram of a pipe-and-filter system.</p><p>TABLE 13.4 Pipe-and-Filter Pattern Solution
-|-
---|---
Overview | Data is transformed from a system&#x2019;s external inputs to its external outputs through a series of transformations performed by its filters connected by pipes.
Elements | <em>Filter</em>, which is a component that transforms data read on its input port(s) to data written on its output port(s). Filters can execute concurrently with each other. Filters can incrementally transform data; that is, they can start producing output as soon as they start processing input. Important characteristics include processing rates, input/output data formats, and the transformation executed by the filter. <br><em>Pipe</em>, which is a connector that conveys data from a filter&#x2019;s output port(s) to another filter&#x2019;s input port(s). A pipe has a single source for its input and a single target for its output. A pipe preserves the sequence of data items, and it does not alter the data passing through. Important characteristics include buffer size, protocol of interaction, transmission speed, and format of the data that passes through a pipe.
Relations | The attachment relation associates the output of filters with the input of pipes and vice versa.
Constraints | Pipes connect filter output ports to filter input ports. <br>Connected filters must agree on the type of data being passed along the connecting pipe. <br>Specializations of the pattern may restrict the association of components to an acyclic graph or a linear sequence, sometimes called a pipeline. <br>Other specializations may prescribe that components have certain named ports, such as the stdin, stdout, and stderr ports of UNIX filters.
Weaknesses | The pipe-and-filter pattern is typically not a good choice for an interactive system. <br>Having large numbers of independent filters can add substantial amounts of computational overhead. <br>Pipe-and-filter systems may not be appropriate for long-running computations.</p><p><img alt="" src="fig.13.8">

Also, decisions about where to locate functionality (in the client or in the server) are often complex and costly to change after a system has been built.</p><p>TABLE 13.5 Client-Server Pattern Solution
-|-
---|---
Overview | Clients initiate interactions with servers, invoking services as needed from those servers and waiting for the results of those requests.
Elements | <em>Client</em>, a component that invokes services of a server component. Clients have ports that describe the services they require. <br><em>Server</em>, a component that provides services to clients. Servers have ports that describe the services they provide. Important characteristics include information about the nature of the server ports (such as how many clients can connect) and performance characteristics (e.g., maximum rates of service invocation). <br><em>Request/reply connector</em>, a data connector employing a request/reply protocol, used by a client to invoke services on a server. Important characteristics include whether the calls are local or remote, and whether data is encrypted.
Relations | The attachment relation associates clients with servers.
Constraints | Clients are connected to servers through request/reply connectors. <br>Server components can be clients to other servers. <br>Specializations may impose restrictions: <br><li> Numbers of attachments to a given port <br></li><li> Allowed relations among servers <br>Components may be arranged in tiers, which are logical groupings of related functionality or functionality that will share a host computing environment (covered more later in this chapter).
Weaknesses | Server can be a performance bottleneck. <br>Server can be a single point of failure. <br>Decisions about where to locate functionality (in the client or in the server) are often complex and costly to change after a system has been built.</li></p><p>Some common examples of systems that use the client-server pattern are these:</p><ul><li>Information systems running on local networks where the clients are GUI-launched applications and the server is a database management system
</li>
<li>Web-based applications where the clients are web browsers and the servers are components running on an e-commerce site
</li></ul>
<p>The computational flow of pure client-server systems is asymmetric: clients initiate interactions by invoking services of servers. Thus, the client must know the identity of a service to invoke it, and clients initiate all interactions. In contrast, servers do not know the identity of clients in advance of a service request and must respond to the initiated client requests.</p><p>In early forms of client-server, service invocation is synchronous: the requester of a service waits, or is blocked, until a requested service completes its actions, possibly providing a return result. However, variants of the client-server pattern may employ more-sophisticated connector protocols. For example:</p><ul><li>Web browsers don&#x2019;t block until the data request is served up.
</li>
<li>In some client-server patterns, servers are permitted to initiate certain actions on their clients. This might be done by allowing a client to register notification procedures, or callbacks, that the server calls at specific times.
</li>
<li>In other systems service calls over a request/reply connector are bracketed by a &#x201C;session&#x201D; that delineates the start and end of a set of a client-server interaction.
</li></ul>
<p>The client-server pattern separates client applications from the services they use. This pattern simplifies systems by factoring out common services, which are reusable. Because servers can be accessed by any number of clients, it is easy to add new clients to a system. Similarly, servers may be replicated to support scalability or availability.</p><p>The World Wide Web is the best-known example of a system that is based on the client-server pattern, allowing clients (web browsers) to access information from servers across the Internet using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is a request/reply protocol. HTTP is stateless; the connection between the client and the server is terminated after each response from the server.</p><p>Figure 13.9 uses an informal notation to describe the client-server view of an automatic teller machine (ATM) banking system.</p><p><img alt="" src="fig.13.9">

All peers are &#x201C;equal&#x201D; and no peer or group of peers can be critical for the health of the system. Peer-to-peer communication is typically a request/reply interaction without the asymmetry found in the client-server pattern. That is, any component can, in principle, interact with any other component by requesting its services. The interaction may be initiated by either party&#x2014;that is, in client-server terms, each peer component is both a client and a server. Sometimes the interaction is just to forward data without the need for a reply. Each peer provides and consumes similar services and uses the same protocol. Connectors in peer-to-peer systems involve bidirectional interactions, reflecting the two-way communication that may exist between two or more peer-to-peer components.</p><p>Peers first connect to the peer-to-peer network on which they discover other peers they can interact with, and then initiate actions to achieve their computation by cooperating with other peers by requesting services. Often a peer&#x2019;s search for another peer is propagated from one peer to its connected peers for a limited number of hops. A peer-to-peer architecture may have specialized peer nodes (called supernodes) that have indexing or routing capabilities and allow a regular peer&#x2019;s search to reach a larger number of peers.</p><p>Peers can be added and removed from the peer-to-peer network with no sig-nificant impact, resulting in great scalability for the whole system. This provides flexibility for deploying the system across a highly distributed platform.</p><p>Typically multiple peers have overlapping capabilities, such as providing access to the same data or providing equivalent services. Thus, a peer acting as client can collaborate with multiple peers acting as servers to complete a certain task. If one of these multiple peers becomes unavailable, the others can still pro-vide the services to complete the task. The result is improved overall availability. There are also performance advantages: The load on any given peer component acting as a server is reduced, and the responsibilities that might have required more server capacity and infrastructure to support it are distributed. This can de-crease the need for other communication for updating data and for central server storage, but at the expense of storing the data locally.</p><p>The drawbacks of the peer-to-peer pattern are strongly related to its strengths. Because peer-to-peer systems are decentralized, managing security, data consistency, data and service availability, backup, and recovery are all more complex. In many cases it is difficult to provide guarantees with peer-to-peer systems because the peers come and go; instead, the architect can, at best, offer probabilities that quality goals will be met, and these probabilities typically in-crease with the size of the population of peers.</p><p>Table 13.6 on the next page summarizes the peer-to-peer pattern solution.</p><p>Peer-to-peer computing is often used in distributed computing applications such as file sharing, instant messaging, desktop grid computing, routing, and wireless ad hoc networking. Examples of peer-to-peer systems include file-shar-ing networks such as BitTorrent and eDonkey, and instant messaging and VoIP applications such as Skype.

<h3 id="service-oriented-architecture-pattern"><a name="service-oriented-architecture-pattern" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#service-oriented-architecture-pattern"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Service-Oriented Architecture Pattern</h3><p><strong>Context</strong>: A number of services are offered (and described) by service provid-ers and consumed by service consumers. Service consumers need to be able to understand and use these services without any detailed knowledge of their implementation.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: How can we support interoperability of distributed components run-ning on different platforms and written in different implementation languages, provided by different organizations, and distributed across the Internet? How can we locate services and combine (and dynamically recombine) them into meaning-ful coalitions while achieving reasonable performance, security, and availability?</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: The service-oriented architecture (SOA) pattern describes a collection of distributed components that provide and/or consume services. In an SOA, ser-vice provider components and service consumer components can use different implementation languages and platforms. Services are largely standalone: service providers and service consumers are usually deployed independently, and often belong to different systems or even different organizations. Components have in-terfaces that describe the services they request from other components and the services they provide. A service&#x2019;s quality attributes can be specified and guar-anteed with a service-level agreement (SLA). In some cases, these are legally binding. Components achieve their computation by requesting services from one another.</p><p>The elements in this pattern include service providers and service consum-ers, which in practice can take different forms, from JavaScript running on a web browser to CICS transactions running on a mainframe. In addition to the service provider and service consumer components, an SOA application may use specialized components that act as intermediaries and provide infrastruc-ture services:</p><ul><li>Service invocation can be mediated by an enterprise service bus (ESB). An ESB routes messages between service consumers and service providers. In addition, an ESB can convert messages from one protocol or technology to another, perform various data transformations (e.g., format, content, split-ting, merging), perform security checks, and manage transactions. Using an ESB promotes interoperability, security, and modifiability. Of course, com-municating through an ESB adds overhead thereby lowering performance, and introduces an additional point of failure. When an ESB is not in place, service providers and consumers communicate with each other in a point-to-point fashion.
</li>
<li>To improve the independence of service providers, a service registry can be used in SOA architectures. The registry is a component that allows services to be registered at runtime. This enables runtime discovery of services, which increases system modifiability by hiding the location and identity of the service provider. A registry can even permit multiple live versions of the same service.
</li>
<li>An orchestration server (or orchestration engine) orchestrates the interac-tion among various service consumers and providers in an SOA system. It executes scripts upon the occurrence of a specific event (e.g., a purchase order request arrived). Applications with well-defined business processes or workflows that involve interactions with distributed components or systems gain in modifiability, interoperability, and reliability by using an orches-tration server. Many commercially available orchestration servers support various workflow or business process language standards.
</li></ul>
<p>The basic types of connectors used in SOA are these:</p><ul><li><em>SOAP</em>. The standard protocol for communication in the web services tech-nology. Service consumers and providers interact by exchanging request/reply XML messages typically on top of HTTP.
</li>
<li><em>Representational State Transfer (REST)</em>. A service consumer sends non-blocking HTTP requests. These requests rely on the four basic HTTP com-mands (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to tell the service provider to create, retrieve, update, or delete a resource.
</li>
<li><em>Asynchronous messaging</em>, a &#x201C;fire-and-forget&#x201D; information exchange. Participants do not have to wait for an acknowledgment of receipt, because the infrastructure is assumed to have delivered the message successfully. The messaging connector can be point-to-point or publish-subscribe.
</li></ul>
<p>In practice, SOA environments may involve a mix of the three connectors just listed, along with legacy protocols and other communication alternatives (e.g., SMTP). Commercial products such as IBM&#x2019;s WebSphere MQ, Microsoft&#x2019;s MSMQ, or Apache&#x2019;s ActiveMQ are infrastructure components that provide asyn-chronous messaging. SOAP and REST are described in more detail in Chapter 6.</p><p>As you can see, the SOA pattern can be quite complex to design and im-plement (due to dynamic binding and the concomitant use of metadata). Other potential problems with this pattern include the performance overhead of the middleware that is interposed between services and clients and the lack of perfor-mance guarantees (because services are shared and, in general, not under control of the requester). These weaknesses are all shared with the broker pattern, which is not surprising because the SOA pattern shares many of the design concepts and goals of broker. In addition, because you do not, in general, control the evolution of the services that you use, you may have to endure high and unplanned-for maintenance costs.</p><p>Table 13.7 summarizes the SOA pattern.</p><p>The main benefit and the major driver of SOA is interoperability. Because service providers and service consumers may run on different platforms, ser-vice-oriented architectures often integrate a variety of systems, including legacy systems. SOA also offers the necessary elements to interact with external ser-vices available over the Internet. Special SOA components such as the registry or the ESB also allow dynamic reconfiguration, which is useful when there&#x2019;s a need to replace or add versions of components with no system interruption.</p><p>Figure 13.11 shows the SOA view of a system called Adventure Builder. Adventure Builder allows a customer on the web to assemble a vacation by choosing an activity and lodging at and transportation to a destination. The Ad-venture Builder system interacts with external service providers to construct the vacation, and with bank services to process payment. The central OPC (Order Processing Center) component coordinates the interaction with internal and ex-ternal service consumers and providers. Note that the external providers can be legacy mainframe systems, Java systems, .NET systems, and so on. The nature of these external components is transparent because SOAP provides the necessary interoperability.</p><p>TABLE 13.7 Service-Oriented Architecture Pattern Solution</p><table>

<p>There are some specific refinements of this pattern that are in common use. We will describe several of these later in this section.</p><p>The computational model for the publish-subscribe pattern is best thought of as a system of independent processes or objects, which react to events generated by their environment, and which in turn cause reactions in other components as a side effect of their event announcements. An example of the publish-subscribe pattern, implemented on top of the Eclipse platform, is shown in Figure 13.12.</p><p>Typical examples of systems that employ the publish-subscribe pattern are the following:</p><ul><li>Graphical user interfaces, in which a user&#x2019;s low-level input actions are treated as events that are routed to appropriate input handlers
</li>
<li>MVC-based applications, in which view components are notified when the state of a model object changes
</li>
<li>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, which integrate many compo-nents, each of which is only interested in a subset of system events
</li>
<li>Extensible programming environments, in which tools are coordinated through events
</li>
<li>Mailing lists, where a set of subscribers can register interest in specific topics
</li></ul>
<p><img alt="" src="fig.13.12">
FIGURE 13.12 A typical publish-subscribe pattern realization</p><ul><li>Social networks, where &#x201C;friends&#x201D; are notified when changes occur to a person&#x2019;s website
</li></ul>
<p>The publish-subscribe pattern is used to send events and messages to an un-known set of recipients. Because the set of event recipients is unknown to the event producer, the correctness of the producer cannot, in general, depend on those recipients. Thus, new recipients can be added without modification to the producers.</p><p>Having components be ignorant of each other&#x2019;s identity results in easy mod-ification of the system (adding or removing producers and consumers of data) but at the cost of runtime performance, because the publish-subscribe infrastructure is a kind of indirection, which adds latency. In addition, if the publish-subscribe connector fails completely, this is a single point of failure for the entire system.</p><p>The publish-subscribe pattern can take several forms:</p><ul><li><em>List-based publish-subscribe</em> is a realization of the pattern where every publisher maintains a subscription list&#x2014;a list of subscribers that have registered an interest in receiving the event. This version of the pattern is less decoupled than others, as we shall see below, and hence it does not provide as much modifiability, but it can be quite efficient in terms of runtime overhead. Also, if the components are distributed, there is no single point of failure.
</li>
<li><em>Broadcast-based publish-subscribe</em> differs from list-based publish-subscribe in that publishers have less (or no) knowledge of the subscribers. Publishers simply publish events, which are then broadcast. Subscribers (or in a distributed system, services that act on behalf of the subscribers) examine each event as it arrives and determine whether the published event is of interest. This version has the potential to be very inefficient if there are lots of messages and most messages are not of interest to a particular subscriber.
</li>
<li><em>Content-based publish-subscribe</em> is distinguished from the previous two variants, which are broadly categorized as &#x201C;topic-based.&#x201D; Topics are predefined events, or messages, and a component subscribes to all events within the topic. Content, on the other hand, is much more general. Each event is associated with a set of attributes and is delivered to a subscriber only if those attributes match subscriber-defined patterns.
</li></ul>
<p>In practice the publish-subscribe pattern is typically realized by some form of message-oriented middleware, where the middleware is realized as a broker, managing the connections and channels of information between producers and consumers. This middleware is often responsible for the transformation of mes-sages (or message protocols), in addition to routing and sometimes storing the messages. Thus the publish-subscribe pattern inherits the strengths and weak-nesses of the broker pattern.</p><h3 id="shared-data-pattern"><a name="shared-data-pattern" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#shared-data-pattern"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Shared-Data Pattern</h3><p><strong>Context</strong>: Various computational components need to share and manipulate large amounts of data. This data does not belong solely to any one of those components.</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: How can systems store and manipulate persistent data that is accessed by multiple independent components?</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: In the shared-data pattern, interaction is dominated by the exchange of persistent data between multiple data accessors and at least one shared-data store. Exchange may be initiated by the accessors or the data store. The connector type is data reading and writing. The general computational model associated with shared-data systems is that data accessors perform operations that require data from the data store and write results to one or more data stores. That data can be viewed and acted on by other data accessors. In a pure shared-data system, data accessors interact only through one or more shared-data stores. However, in practice shared-data systems also allow direct interactions between data accessors. The data-store components of a shared-data system provide shared access to data, support data persistence, man-age concurrent access to data through transaction management, provide fault toler-ance, support access control, and handle the distribution and caching of data values.</p><p>Specializations of the shared-data pattern differ with respect to the nature of the stored data&#x2014;existing approaches include relational, object structures, lay-ered, and hierarchical structures.</p><p>Although the sharing of data is a critical task for most large, complex sys-tems, there are a number of potential problems associated with this pattern. For one, the shared-data store may be a performance bottleneck. For this reason, performance optimization has been a common theme in database research. The shared-data store is also potentially a single point of failure. Also, the producers and consumers of the shared data may be tightly coupled, through their knowl-edge of the structure of the shared data.</p><p>The shared-data pattern solution is summarized in Table 13.9.</p><p>The shared-data pattern is useful whenever various data items are persistent and have multiple accessors. Use of this pattern has the effect of decoupling the producer of the data from the consumers of the data; hence, this pattern supports modifiabil-ity, as the producers do not have direct knowledge of the consumers. Consolidating the data in one or more locations and accessing it in a common fashion facilitates performance tuning. Analyses associated with this pattern usually center on qualities such as data consistency, performance, security, privacy, availability, scalability, and compatibility with, for example, existing repositories and their data.</p><p>When a system has more than one data store, a key architecture concern is the mapping of data and computation to the data. Use of multiple stores may occur be-cause the data is naturally, or historically, partitioned into separable stores. In other cases data may be replicated over several stores to improve performance or availabil-ity through redundancy. Such choices can strongly affect the qualities noted above.</p><p>Figure 13.13 shows the diagram of a shared-data view of an enterprise access management system. There are three types of accessor components: Windows applications, web applications, and headless programs (programs or scripts that run in background and don&#x2019;t provide any user interface).</p><p>TABLE 13.9 Shared-Data Pattern Solution</p><table>

Examples include logs of inter-actions in a social network site, massive document or data repositories, and pairs of <source, target=""> web links for a search engine. Programs for the analysis of this data should be easy to write, run efficiently, and be resilient with respect to hardware failure.</source,></p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: For many applications with ultra-large data sets, sorting the data and then analyzing the grouped data is sufficient. The problem the map-reduce pat-tern solves is to efficiently perform a distributed and parallel sort of a large data set and provide a simple means for the programmer to specify the analysis to be done.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: The map-reduce pattern requires three parts: First, a specialized infra-structure takes care of allocating software to the hardware nodes in a massively parallel computing environment and handles sorting the data as needed. A node may be a standalone processor or a core in a multi-core chip. Second and third are two programmer-coded functions called, predictably enough, map and reduce.</p><p>The map function takes as input a key (key1) and a data set. The purpose of the map function is to filter and sort the data set. All of the heavy analysis takes place in the reduce function. The input key in the map function is used to filter the data. Whether a data record is to be involved in further processing is deter-mined by the map function. A second key (key2) is also important in the map function. This is the key that is used for sorting. The output of the map function consists of a <key2, value=""> pair, where the key2 is the sorting value and the value is derived from the input record.</key2,></p><p>Sorting is performed by a combination of the map and the infrastructure. Each record output by map is hashed by key2 into a disk partition. The infra-structure maintains an index file for key2 on the disk partition. This allows for the values on the disk partition to be retrieved in key2 order.</p><p>The performance of the map phase of map-reduce is enhanced by having multiple map instances, each processing a different portion of the disk file being processed. Figure 13.14 shows how the map portion of map-reduce processes data. An input file is divided into portions, and a number of map instances are created to process each portion. The map function processes its portion into a number of partitions, based on programmer-specified logic.</p><p>The reduce function is provided with all the sets of <key2, value=""> pairs emit-ted by all the map instances in sorted order. Reduce does some programmer-spec-ified analysis and then emits the results of that analysis. The output set is almost always much smaller than the input sets, hence the name &#x201C;reduce.&#x201D; The term &#x201C;load&#x201D; is sometimes used to describe the final set of data emitted. Figure 13.14 also shows one instance (of many possible instances) of the reduce processing, called Reduce Instance 2. Reduce Instance 2 is receiving data from all of the Partition 2s produced by the various map instances. It is possible that there are several iterations of reduce for large files, but this is not shown in Figure 13.14.</key2,></p><p>A classic teaching problem for map-reduce is counting word occurrences in a document. This example can be carried out with a single map function. The document is the data set. The map function will find every word in the document and output a <word, 1=""> pair for each. For example, if the document begins with the words &#x201C;Having a whole book . . . ,&#x201D; then the first results of map will be</word,></p><pre><code>&lt;Having, 1&gt;
&lt;a, 1&gt;
&lt;whole, 1&gt;
&lt;book, 1&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In practice, the &#x201C;a&#x201D; would be one of the words filtered by map.</p><p>Pseudocode for map might look like this:</p><pre><code>map(String key, String value):
// key: document name
// value: document contents
for each word w in value:
Emit (w, &#x201C;1&#x201D;);</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="fig.13.14">
FIGURE 13.14 A component-and-connector view of map-reduce showing how the data processed by map is partitioned and subsequently processed by reduce</p><p>The reduce function will take that list in sorted order, add up the 1s for each word to get a count, and output the result.</p><p>The corresponding reduce function would look like this:</p><pre><code>reduce(List &lt;key, value&gt;):
// key: a word
// value: an integer
int result = 0;
sort input
for each input value:
for each input pair with same word
result ++ ;
Emit (word, result)
result = 0</code></pre>
<p>Larger data sets lead to a much more interesting solution. Suppose we want to continuously analyze Twitter posts over the last hour to see what topics are currently &#x201C;trending.&#x201D; This is analogous to counting word occurrences in millions of documents. In that case, each document (tweet) can be assigned to its own in-stance of the map function. (If you don&#x2019;t have millions of processors handy, you can break the tweet collection into groups that match the number of processors in your processor farm, and process the collection in waves, one group after the other.) Or we can use a dictionary to give us a list of words, and each map func-tion can be assigned its own word to look for across all tweets.</p><p>There can also be multiple instances of reduce. These are usually arranged so that the reduction happens in stages, with each stage processing a smaller list (with a smaller number of reduce instances) than the previous stage. The final stage is handled by a single reduce function that produces the final output.</p><p>Of course, the map-reduce pattern is not appropriate in all instances. Some considerations that would argue against adopting this pattern are these:</p><ul><li>If you do not have large data sets, then the overhead of map-reduce is not justified.
</li>
<li>If you cannot divide your data set into similar sized subsets, the advantages of parallelism are lost.
</li>
<li>If you have operations that require multiple reduces, this will be complex to orchestrate.
</li></ul>
<p>Commercial implementations of map-reduce provide infrastructure that takes care of assignment of function instances to hardware, recovery and reas-signment in case of hardware failure (a common occurrence in massively parallel computing environments), and utilities like sorting of the massive lists that are produced along the way.</p><p>Table 13.10 summarizes the solution of the map-reduce pattern.</p><p>Map-reduce is a cornerstone of the software of some of the most familiar names on the web, including Google, Facebook, eBay, and Yahoo!</p><p>TABLE 13.10 Map-Reduce Pattern Solution</p><table>

Tiers can be created to group components of similar functionality, in which case it is a C&amp;C pattern. However, in many, if not most, cases tiers are defined with an eye toward the computing environment on which the software will run: A client tier in an enterprise system will not be running on the computer that hosts the database. That makes it an allocation pattern, mapping software elements&#x2014;perhaps produced by applying C&amp;C patterns&#x2014;to computing elements. Because of that reason, we have chosen to list it as an allocation pattern.</p><p><strong>Context</strong>: In a distributed deployment, there is often a need to distribute a sys-tem&#x2019;s infrastructure into distinct subsets. This may be for operational or business reasons (for example, different parts of the infrastructure may belong to different organizations).</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: How can we split the system into a number of computationally inde-pendent execution structures&#x2014;groups of software and hardware&#x2014;connected by some communications media? This is done to provide specific server environ-ments optimized for operational requirements and resource usage.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>: The execution structures of many systems are organized as a set of logical groupings of components. Each grouping is termed a tier. The grouping of components into tiers may be based on a variety of criteria, such as the type of component, sharing the same execution environment, or having the same runtime purpose.</p><p>The use of tiers may be applied to any collection (or pattern) of runtime components, although in practice it is most often used in the context of cli-ent-server patterns. Tiers induce topological constraints that restrict which com-ponents may communicate with other components. Specifically, connectors may exist only between components in the same tier or residing in adjacent tiers. The multi-tier pattern found in many Java EE and Microsoft .NET applications is an example of organization in tiers derived from the client-server pattern.</p><p>Additionally, tiers may constrain the kinds of communication that can take place across adjacent tiers. For example, some tiered patterns require call-return communication in one direction but event-based notification in the other.</p><p>The main weakness with the multi-tier architecture is its cost and complex-ity. For simple systems, the benefits of the multi-tier architecture may not justify its up-front and ongoing costs, in terms of hardware, software, and design and implementation complexity.</p><p>Tiers are not components, but rather logical groupings of components. Also, don&#x2019;t confuse tiers with layers! Layering is a pattern of modules (a unit of imple-mentation), while tiers applies only to runtime entities.</p><p>Table 13.11 summarizes the solution part of the multi-tier pattern.</p><p>Tiers make it easier to ensure security, and to optimize performance and availability in specialized ways. They also enhance the modifiability of the sys-tem, as the computationally independent subgroups need to agree on protocols for interaction, thus reducing their coupling.</p><p>Figure 13.15 uses an informal notation to describe the multi-tier architecture of the Consumer Website Java EE application. This application is part of the Ad-venture Builder system. Many component-and-connector types are specific to the supporting platform, which is Java EE in this case.</p><p>TABLE 13.11 Multi-tier Pattern Solution</p><table>

FIGURE 13.15 A multi-tier view of the Consumer Website Java EE application, which is part of the Adventure Builder system</p><h3 id="other-allocation-patterns"><a name="other-allocation-patterns" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#other-allocation-patterns"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Other allocation Patterns.</h3><p>There are several published deployment styles. Microsoft publishes a &#x201C;Tiered Distribution&#x201D; pattern, which prescribes a particular allocation of components in a multi-tier architecture to the hardware they will run on. Similarly, IBM&#x2019;s WebSphere handbooks describe a number of what they call &#x201C;topologies&#x201D; along with the quality attribute criteria for choosing among them. There are 11 topologies (specialized deployment patterns) described for Web-Sphere version 6, including the &#x201C;single machine topology (stand-alone server),&#x201D; &#x201C;reverse proxy topology,&#x201D; &#x201C;vertical scaling topology,&#x201D; &#x201C;horizontal scaling topol-ogy,&#x201D; and &#x201C;horizontal scaling with IP sprayer topology.&#x201D;</p><p>There are also published work assignment patterns. These take the form of often-used team structures. For example, patterns for globally distributed Agile projects include these:</p><ul><li>Platform. In software product line development, one site is tasked with developing reusable core assets of the product line, and other sites develop applications that use the core assets.
</li>
<li>Competence center. Work is allocated to sites depending on the technical or domain expertise located at a site. For example, user interface design is done at a site where usability engineering experts are located.
</li>
<li>Open source. Many independent contributors develop the software product in accordance with a technical integration strategy. Centralized control is minimal, except when an independent contributor integrates his code into the product line.
</li></ul>

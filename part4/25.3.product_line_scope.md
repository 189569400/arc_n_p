25.3 Product Line Scope 产品线范围
===

One of the most important inputs to an architect building an architecture for a software product line is the product line’s scope. A product line’s scope is a statement about what systems an organization is willing to build as part of its line and what systems it is not willing to build. Defining a product line’s scope is like drawing a doughnut in the space of all possible systems, as shown in Figure 25.1. The doughnut’s center represents the systems that the organization could easily build using its base of core assets; these are within its production capability. Systems outside the doughnut are out of scope because they are ones the product line’s core assets are not well equipped to handle; this would be like asking Toyota to build, say, apple pies on one of its automotive assembly lines.

FIGURE 25.1 The space of all possible systems is divided into areas within scope (white), areas outside of scope (speckled), and areas that require case-by-case disposition (gray).

Systems on the doughnut itself could be handled, but with some effort. These often represent invitations from the marketplace asking the organization to extend its product line. To take advantage of such an opportunity, the organization would have to broaden its production capability—that is, make its core asset base able to handle the new product. These opportunities require case-by-case disposition as they arise, to see if the potential payoff (such as entry into a slightly different area of the market) would outweigh the cost to modify the core assets. This would be like asking Toyota to build a riding lawnmower.

The scope represents the organization’s best prediction about what products it will be asked to build in the foreseeable future. Input to the scoping process comes from the organization’s strategic planners, marketing staff, domain analysts who can catalog similar systems (both existing and on the drawing board), and technology experts.

A product line scope is a critical factor in the success of the product line. Scope too narrowly (the products only vary in a small number of features) and an insufficient number of products will be derived to justify the investment in development. Scope too broadly (the products vary in kind as well as in features) and the effort required to develop individual products from the core assets is too great to lead to significant savings. Scope can be refined as a portion of the initial establishment of the product line or opportunistically depending on the product line adoption strategy (see the section on adoption strategies in Section 25.8).

The problem in defining the scope is not in finding commonality—a creative architect can find points of commonality between any two systems—but in finding commonality that can be exploited to substantially reduce the cost of constructing the systems that an organization intends to build. When considering scope, more than just the systems being built should be considered. Market segmentation and types of customer interactions assumed will help determine the scope of any particular product line. For example, Philips, the Dutch manufacturer of consumer electronics, has distinct product lines for home video electronic systems and digital video communication. Video is the common thread, but one is a mass market, where the customer is assumed to have very little video sophistication, and the other is a much smaller market consisting purely of video professionals. The products being developed reflect these assumptions about the sophistication of customers and the amount of care each customer will receive. These differences were sufficient to keep Philips from attempting to develop a single product line for both markets.

Narrowly scoped product lines offer opportunities to build specialized tools to support the specification of new products. For example, General Motors’ Powertrain division builds a software product line of automotive software. It makes an individual product from its product line core assets based on contracts stored in a database. Each element has well-defined interfaces and possible variation points. A tool searches the database based on desired features and assembles the product.

The scope definition is vital to the product line architect because the scope defines what is common across all members of the product line, and the specific ways in which the products differ from each other. The fixed part of a product line architecture reflects what is constant, and the architecture’s variation points accommodate the variations among products.

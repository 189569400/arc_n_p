24.1 Competence of Individuals: Duties, Skills, and Knowledge of Architects 个人能力：架构师的职责、技能和知识
===

Architects perform many activities beyond directly producing an architecture. These activities, which we call duties, form the backbone of an individual’s architecture competence. We surveyed a broad body of information aimed at architects (such as websites, courses, books, and position descriptions for architects). We also surveyed practicing architects. These surveys tell us that duties are but one aspect of individual competence. Writers about architects also speak of skills and knowledge. For example, the ability to communicate ideas clearly and to negotiate effectively are skills often ascribed to competent architects. In addition, architects need to have up-to-date knowledge about patterns, database platforms, web services standards, quality attributes, and a host of other topics.

Duties, skills, and knowledge [^1] form a triad upon which architecture competence for individuals rests. The relationship among these three is shown in Figure 24.1—namely, skills and knowledge support the ability to perform the required duties. Infinitely talented architects are of no use if they cannot (for whatever reason) perform the duties required of the position; we would not say they were competent.

To give examples of these concepts:

* “Design the architecture” is a duty.
* “Ability to think abstractly” is a skill.
* “Patterns and tactics” is a part of the body of knowledge.

This example purposely illustrates that skills and knowledge are important (only) for supporting the ability to carry out duties effectively. As another example, “documenting the architecture” is a duty, “ability to write clearly” is a skill, and “ISO Standard 42010” is part of the related body of knowledge. Of course, a skill or knowledge area can support more than one duty.

Knowing the duties, skills, and knowledge of architects (or, more precisely, the duties, skills, and knowledge that are needed of architects in a particular organizational setting) can help establish measurement and improvement strategies for individual architects. If you want to improve your individual architectural
competence, you should do the following:

1. _Gain experience carrying out the duties_. Apprenticeship is a productive path to achieving experience. Education alone is not enough, because education without on-the-job application merely enhances knowledge.
2. _Improve your nontechnical skills_. This dimension of improvement involves taking professional development courses, for example, in leadership or time management. Some people will never become truly great leaders or communicators, but we can all improve on these skills.
3. _Master the body of knowledge_. One of the most important things a competent architect must do is master the body of knowledge and remain up to date on it. To emphasize the importance of remaining up to date, consider the advances in knowledge required for architects that have emerged in just the last few years. For example, the cloud and edge computing that we discuss in Chapters 26 and 27 were not important topics several years ago. Taking courses, becoming certified, reading books and journals, visiting websites and portals, reading blogs, attending architecture-oriented conferences, joining professional societies, and meeting with other architects are all useful ways to improve knowledge.

# Duties

This section summarizes a wide variety of an architect’s duties. Not every architect in every organization will perform every one of these duties on every project. But a competent architect should not be surprised to find himself or herself engaged in any of the activities listed here. We divide the duties into technical duties (Table 24.1) and nontechnical duties (Table 24.2). One immediate observation you should make is how many nontechnical duties there are. An obvious implication, for those of you who wish to be architects, is that you must pay adequate attention to the nontechnical aspects of your education and your professional activities.

# Skills

Given the wide range of duties enumerated in the previous section, what skills (beyond mastery of the technical body of knowledge) does an architect need to possess? Much has been written about the architect’s special role of leadership in a project; the ideal architect is an effective communicator, manager, team builder, visionary, and mentor. Some certificate or certification programs emphasize non-technical skills. Common to these certification programs are nontechnical assessment areas of leadership, organization dynamics, and communication.

Table 24.3 enumerates the set of nontechnical skills most useful to an architect.

* Be familiar with supporting disciplines such as configuration management and project management
* Understand current design and implementation tools and technologies 

Knowledge and experience in one or more application domains is also necessary.

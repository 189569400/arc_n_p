24 Architecture Competence
===

_The ideal architect should be a man of letters, a skillful draftsman, a mathematician, familiar with historical studies, a diligent student of philosophy, acquainted with music, not ignorant of medicine, learned in the responses of jurisconsults, familiar with astronomy and astronomical calculations._  
—Vitruvius, De Architectura (25 B.C.)

_The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne._  
—Geoffrey Chaucer

If software architecture is worth “doing,” surely it’s worth doing well. Most of the literature about architecture concentrates on the technical aspects. This is not surprising; it is a deeply technical discipline. There is little information that speaks to the fact that architectures are created by architects working in organizations, full of actual human beings. Dealing with these humans is decidedly nontechnical. What can be done to help architects, especially architects-in-training, be better at this important dimension of their job? And what can be done to help architecture organizations do a better job in fostering their architects to produce their best work?

如果软件架构值得“去做”，那么肯定值得去做。 有关架构的大多数文献都集中在技术方面。 这不足为奇。 这是一门深厚的技术学科。 几乎没有什么信息可以说明这样一个事实，即架构是由在实际的人类中工作的组织中的架构师创建的。 与这些人打交道绝对是非技术性的。 可以采取什么措施来帮助架构师，尤其是培训架构师，在其工作的这一重要方面变得更好？ 可以采取什么措施来帮助架构组织在培养架构师以产生最佳作品方面做得更好？

An organization’s ability to routinely produce high-quality architectures that are aligned with its business goals well cannot be understood simply through examination of past architectures and measurement of their deficiencies. The organizational and human causes of those deficiencies also need to be understood.

仅仅通过检查过去的架构并衡量其缺陷，就无法理解组织例行生产符合其业务目标的高质量架构的能力。 还需要了解造成这些缺陷的组织原因和人为原因。

This chapter is about the competence of individual architects and the organizations that wish to produce high-quality architects. We define the architecture competence of an organization as follows:

本章介绍了架构师个人和希望培养高素质架构师的组织的能力。 我们定义组织的架构能力如下：

  The architecture competence of an organization is the ability of that organization to grow, use, and sustain the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively carry out architecture-centric practices at the individual, team, and organizational levels to produce architectures with acceptable cost that lead to systems aligned with the organization’s business goals.

  组织的架构能力是该组织发展、使用和维持必要的技能和知识的能力，这些技能和知识可以有效地在个人、团队和组织级别上执行以架构为中心的实践，从而以可接受的成本产生可导致 与组织的业务目标一致的系统。

Because the architecture competence of an organization depends, in part, on the competence of architects, we begin by asking what it is that architects are expected to do, know, and be skilled at. Then we’ll look at what organizations can and should do to help their architects produce better architectures. Individual and organizational competencies are intertwined. Studying only one or the other won’t do.

因为组织的架构能力部分取决于架构师的能力，所以我们首先要问架构师应具备的知识、技能和技能。 然后，我们将研究组织可以并且应该做些什么来帮助其架构师开发出更好的架构。 个人和组织能力是交织在一起的。 只学习其中一项不会。

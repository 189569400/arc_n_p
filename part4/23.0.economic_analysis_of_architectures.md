Thus far, we have been primarily investigating the relationships between architectural decisions and the quality attributes that the architecture’s stakeholders have deemed important: If I make this architectural decision, what effect will it have on the quality attributes? If I have to achieve that quality attribute requirement, what architectural decisions will do the trick?

到目前为止，我们一直在主要研究架构决策与架构利益相关者认为重要的质量属性之间的关系：如果我做出此架构决策，它将对质量属性产生什么影响？ 如果我必须达到那个质量属性要求，那么什么架构决策会成功呢？

As important as this effort is, this perspective is missing a crucial consideration: What are the economic implications of an architectural decision?

尽管这项工作非常重要，但这种观点却缺少关键的考虑因素：架构决策的经济意义是什么？

Usually an economic discussion is focused on costs, primarily the costs of building the system in the first place. Other costs, often but not always downplayed, include the long-term costs incurred through cycles of maintenance and upgrade. However, as we argue in this chapter, as important as costs are the benefits that an architectural decision may bring to an organization.

通常，经济讨论的重点是成本，首先是构建系统的成本。 其他成本（通常但不总是被低估）包括维护和升级周期产生的长期成本。 但是，正如本章所述，架构决策可能给组织带来的好处与成本一样重要。

Given that the resources for building and maintaining a system are finite, there must be a rational process that helps us choose among architectural options, during both an initial design phase and subsequent upgrade periods. These options will have different costs, will consume differing amounts of resources, will implement different features (each of which brings some benefit to the organization), and will have some inherent risk or uncertainty. To capture these aspects, we need economic models of software that take into account costs, benefits, risks, and schedule implications.

鉴于用于构建和维护系统的资源是有限的，因此必须有一个合理的过程来帮助我们在初始设计阶段和后续升级阶段中从架构选项中进行选择。 这些选择将具有不同的成本，将消耗不同的资源量，将实现不同的功能（每个功能都会给组织带来一些好处），并且将具有固有的风险或不确定性。 为了捕获这些方面，我们需要考虑成本，收益，风险和进度影响的软件经济模型。

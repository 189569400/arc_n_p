23.1 Decision-Making Context 决策背景
===

As we saw in Chapter 16, business goals play a key role in requirements for architectures. Because major architectural decisions have technical and economic implications, the business goals behind a software system should be used to directly guide those decisions. The most immediate economic implication of a business goal decision on an architecture is how it affects the cost of implementing the system. The quality attributes achieved by the architecture decisions have additional economic implications because of the benefits (which we call utility) that can be derived from those decisions; for example, making the system faster or more secure or easier to maintain and update. It is this interplay between the costs and the benefits of architectural decisions that guides (and torments) the architect. Figure 23.1 show this interplay.

For example, using redundant hardware to achieve a desired level of availability has a cost; checkpointing to a disk file has a different cost. Furthermore, both of these architectural decisions will result in (presumably different) measurable levels of availability that will have some value to the organization developing the system. Perhaps the organization believes that its stakeholders will pay more for a highly available system (a telephone switch or medical monitoring software, for example) or that it will be sued if the system fails (for example, the software that controls antilock brakes in an automobile).

Knowing the costs and benefits associated with particular decisions enables reasoned selection from among competing alternatives. The economic analysis does not make decisions for the stakeholders, just as a financial advisor does not tell you how to invest your money. It simply aids in the elicitation and documentation of value for cost (VFC): a function of the costs, benefits, and uncertainty of a “portfolio” of architectural investments. It gives the stakeholders a framework within which they can apply a rational decision-making process that suits their needs and their risk aversion.

Economic analysis isn’t something to apply to every architectural decision, but rather to the most basic ones that put an overarching architectural strategy in place. It can help you assess the viability of that strategy. It can also be the key to objective selection among competing strategies, each of which might have advocates pushing their own self-interests.

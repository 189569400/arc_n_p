_Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together
is progress. Working together is success._  
—Henry Ford

A software architecture represents a significant investment of time and effort, usually by senior talent. So it is natural to want to maximize the return on this investment by reusing an architecture across multiple systems.

软件架构通常是由高级人才进行的重大时间和精力投入。 因此，很自然地希望通过在多个系统之间重用架构来最大化此投资的回报。

There are many ways this happens in practice. The patterns we discussed in Chapter 13 are a big step in this direction; using a pattern is reusing a package of architectural decisions (albeit not a complete architecture). And strictly speaking, every time you make a change to a system, you are reusing its architecture (or whatever portion of its architecture you don’t have to change).

在实践中有很多方式发生这种情况。 我们在第13章中讨论的模式是朝这个方向迈出的一大步。 使用模式会重用一整套架构决策（尽管不是完整的架构）。 严格来说，每次对系统进行更改时，您都在重用其架构（或者您不必更改其架构的任何部分）。

This chapter shows yet another way to reuse a software architecture (and many other assets as well) across a family of related systems, and the benefits that doing so can bring. Many software-producing organizations tend to produce systems or products that resemble each other more than they differ. This is an opportunity for reusing the architecture across these similar products. These software product lines simplify the creation of new members of a family of similar systems.

本章展示了在一系列相关系统中重用软件架构（以及许多其他资产）的另一种方法，以及这样做的好处。 许多软件生产组织倾向于生产彼此相似的系统或产品。 这是在这些类似产品之间重用架构的机会。 这些软件产品线简化了一系列类似系统的新成员的创建。

This kind of reuse has been shown to bring substantial benefits that include reduced cost of construction, higher quality, and greatly reduced time to market. This is the lure of the software product line approach to system building.

事实证明，这种重用带来了很多好处，包括降低了建造成本，提高了质量并大大缩短了上市时间。 这就是软件产品线方法进行系统构建的诱惑。

The Software Engineering Institute defines a software product line as “a set of software-intensive systems sharing a common, managed set of features that satisfy the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way.”

软件工程学院将软件产品线定义为“一组软件密集型系统，它们共享一组共同的、受管的功能，这些功能可以满足特定细分市场或任务的特定需求，并且是通过使用一组通用的核心资产开发而成的。 规定的方式。”

The vision is of a set of reusable assets (called core assets) based on a common architecture and the software elements that populate that architecture. The core assets also include designs and their documentation, user manuals, project management artifacts such as budgets and schedules, software test plans and test cases, and more.

愿景是基于共同的体系结构和构成该架构的软件元素，提供一组可重复使用的资产（称为核心资产）。 核心资产还包括设计及其文档，用户手册，项目管理工件（例如预算和进度表），软件测试计划和测试用例等。

The product line approach works because the core assets were built specifically to support multiple members of the same family of products. Hence, reusing them is faster and less expensive than reinventing those software assets for each new product or system in the organization’s portfolio. Core assets, including the architecture, are usually designed with built-in variation points—places where they can be quickly tailored in preplanned ways.

产品线方法之所以行之有效，是因为核心资产是专门为支持同一系列产品的多个成员而构建的。 因此，与为组织产品组合中的每个新产品或系统重新发明这些软件资产相比，重新使用它们更快，更便宜。 核心资产（包括架构）通常设计有内置的变更点，这些地方可以以预先计划的方式快速定制它们。

Once the core assets are in place, system building becomes a matter of

核心资产到位后，系统构建就成为

* Accessing the appropriate assets in the core asset base
* 访问核心资产库中的适当资产
* Exercising the variation points to configure them as required for the system being built
* 行使变化点以根据要构建的系统的要求对其进行配置
* Assembling that system
* 组装该系统

In the ideal case, this can be done automatically. Additional software developed for an individual product, if needed at all, tends to account for a small fraction of the total software. Integration and testing replace design and coding as the predominant activities.

在理想情况下，这可以自动完成。 如果根本需要为单个产品开发的其他软件，则占全部软件的一小部分。 集成和测试取代了设计和编码成为主要活动。

Product lines are nothing new in manufacturing. Many historians trace the concept to Eli Whitney’s use of interchangeable parts to build rifles in the early 1800s, but earlier examples also exist. Today, there are hundreds of examples in manufacturing: think of the products of companies like General Motors, Toyota, Boeing, Airbus, Dell, even McDonald’s, and the portfolio of similar products that each one produces. Each company exploits commonality in different ways. Boeing, for example, developed the 757 and 767 in tandem, and the parts lists of these two very different aircraft overlap by about 60 percent.

产品线在制造业中并不是什么新鲜事物。 许多历史学家将这一概念追溯到伊利·惠特尼（Eli Whitney）在1800年代初使用可互换零件制造步枪的过程中，但也存在较早的例子。 如今，制造业中有数百个示例：想想通用汽车、丰田、波音、空中客车、戴尔，甚至麦当劳等公司的产品，以及每个公司生产的类似产品组合。 每个公司都以不同的方式利用共性。 例如，波音公司同时开发了757和767，这两架完全不同的飞机的零件清单重叠了大约60％。

The improvements in cost, time to market, and productivity that come with a successful software product line can be breathtaking. Consider:

成功的软件产品线所带来的成本、上市时间和生产率的提高令人叹为观止。 考虑：

* Nokia credits the software product line approach with giving it flexibility to bring over a dozen phones to market each year, as opposed to the three or so it could manage before, all with an unprecedented variety of features.
* Cummins, Inc., was able to reduce the time it takes to produce the software for a diesel engine from about a year to about a week.
* Hewlett-Packard builds products using one-quarter of the staff, in one-third of the time, and with one twenty-fifth the number of defects, compared with software built before the advent of software product line engineering.
* Deutsche Bank estimates $4 million in savings per year realized from building its global transaction and settlement software as a product line.
* Philips reports reduced faults during integration in its high-end television portfolio by adopting the product line approach. Product diversity used to be one of the top three concerns of their architects. Now it doesn’t even make the list of concerns at all; the product line approach has taken software development off the critical path—the software no longer determines the delivery date of the product.
* With a product line of satellite ground control systems it commissioned, the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office reported the first product requiring 10 percent the expected number of developers and having one-tenth the expected number of defects.
* In Philips’s medical systems product line, the software product line approach has cut both software defects and time to market by more than half.

Creating a successful product line depends on a coordinated strategy involving software engineering, technical management, and organization management. Because this is a book on software architecture, we focus on the architectural aspects of software product lines, but all aspects must work together in order for an organization to successfully create a product line.

> The software product line paradigm is a powerful way to leverage an investment in architecture (and other core assets) into a family of related systems and thus see order-of-magnitude improvements in time to market, quality, and productivity. These results are possible and have been demonstrated by companies large and small in many different domains. The effects are real. Further, data from many sources and companies confirms with astonishing consistency that, to make the investment pay off, an organization needs to build only three products. This is the minimum number we would expect to have in a product line.

> But other results are possible as well, and a spectacular crash-and-burn is not out of the question when trying to adopt this approach. Product line practice, like any technology, needs careful thought given to its adoption, and a company’s history, situation, and culture must be taken into account. Factors that can contribute to product line failure include these:
>
> * Lack of a champion in a position of sufficient control and visibility
> * Failure of management to provide sustained and unwavering support
> * Reluctance of middle managers to relinquish autocratic control of projects
> * Failure to clearly identify business goals for adopting the product line approach
> * Abandoning the approach at the first sign of difficulty
> * Failure to adequately train staff in the approach and failure to explain or justify the change adequately
> * Lack of discipline in managing the architecture’s variation points
> * Scoping the product line too broadly or too narrowly
> * Lack of product line tooling to help manage and exercise the variation points
>
> Fortunately, there are strategies for overcoming most of these factors. One good strategy is to launch a small but visible pilot project to demonstrate the quantitative benefits of software product lines. The pilot can be staffed by those most willing to try something new while the skeptics go about their business. It can work out process issues, clarify roles and responsibilities, and in general work out the bugs before the approach is transitioned to a wider setting.

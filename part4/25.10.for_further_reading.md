[Clements 01a] is a comprehensive treatment of software product lines. It includes a number of case studies as well as a thorough discussion of product line “practice areas,” which are areas of expertise a product line organization should have (or should develop) to help bring about product line success.

[van der Linden 07] contains a rich set of product line case studies.

[Anastasopoulos 00] presents a good list of variation mechanisms, as do [Jacobson 97] and [Svahnberg 00]. [Bachmann 05] provides a list of their own, as well as a treatment of each in terms of cost (it was the source for Table 25.2). Organizational models for software product lines are treated in [Bosch 00].

There is an active software product line community of research and practice. The Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is the mainstream forum for new software product line research and success stories. You can find it at www.splc. net. SPLC maintains a “Software Product Line Hall of Fame,” which showcases successful software product lines that can serve as engineering models (and inspiration) to aspiring product line organizations. Each year, new members of the Hall of Fame are nominated, and in most years a new candidate is inducted. You can see the winners at www.splc.net/fame.html.

The SEI’s website contains a wealth of material about software product lines, including a collection of “getting started” material: www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines.

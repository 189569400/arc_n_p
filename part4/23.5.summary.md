Architecture-based economic analysis is grounded on understanding the utility-response curve of various scenarios and casting them into a form that makes them comparable. Once they are in this common form—based on the common coin of utility—the VFC for each architecture improvement, with respect to each relevant scenario, can be calculated and compared.

Applying the theory in practice has a number of practical difficulties, but in spite of those difficulties, we believe that the application of economic techniques is inherently better than the ad hoc decision-making approaches that projects (even quite sophisticated ones) employ today. Our experience with the CBAM tells us that giving people the appropriate tools to frame and structure their discussions and decision making is an enormous benefit to the disciplined development of a complex software system.

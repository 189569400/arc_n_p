The vast majority of work on software and systems architecture (including our own) has focused on the technical aspects. But an architecture is much more than a technical “blueprint” for a system. This has led us to try to understand, in a more holistic way, what an architect and an architecture-centric organization must do to succeed. To this end, we have developed a framework that aids us in assessing an organization for competence.

We use the framework to ask questions about an organization’s practices. We can also ask about recent architecture successes and failures, and investigate the causes of each. The output of this exercise is a formal report that assesses competence at organization, team, and individual levels. Along with this report we make improvement recommendations based on assessment results; these, too, are tied to the underlying competence models.

You can do the same sort of evaluation on your own organization. The key to the process is in understanding the various models and in creating questions based on these models that aid you in assessing how well you are doing in those areas that you care about. Given this knowledge, you can create your own improvement plan, as an individual architect or for an entire organization.
